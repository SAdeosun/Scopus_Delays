TI  - How to save a life: Public awareness of a national mass media take home naloxone 
      campaign, and effects of exposure to campaign components on overdose knowledge 
      and responses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Take home naloxone (THN) programmes are effective at reducing opioid 
      related mortality, but require high levels of distribution, including to the 
      general public. Mass media campaigns can be effective in improving public 
      understanding of a topic and encouraging behavior change. Whilst mass media 
      campaigns focusing on naloxone have been developed internationally, there is a 
      lack of research on their potential impact. We investigated the effects of 
      components of a recent national mass media campaign (Scotland, UK) designed to 
      improve public awareness of drug related deaths, and readiness to intervene. 
      METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional online experimental study with a 
      randomized design, conducted with a nationally representative sample. 
      Participants (N = 1551; 52.6% female; age 46.1±16.5 years) were assessed on 
      overdose knowledge and readiness to intervene after presentation of eight 
      combinations of campaign components. RESULTS: Compared to a basic campaign 
      description, exposure to all types of campaign component were associated with 
      higher overdose knowledge (p < .001), but not knowledge of what to do in response 
      to an overdose (p = .374), or readiness to intervene (p= .286). The greatest 
      effects were associated with a media rich audio-visual resource (animated video 
      with a popular song on the soundtrack, and narrated by a well-known actor). 
      CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that harm reduction is an appropriate topic for 
      large-scale mass media campaigns. However, effects may be limited to knowledge 
      and awareness raising in the general public, and may be related to the types of 
      media used. Audience segmentation is important and more general messaging about 
      drug related deaths may be more appropriate for the majority of audiences.

LID - 10.1177/15248399221126163 [doi]
AB  - People who use drugs (PWUD) face stigmatizing treatment and substandard care 
      during all stages of their health care journey, including in the prehospital 
      setting by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers. Drawing on the 
      professional and lived experience of the authors, we have developed a training 
      with an intended audience of Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and Paramedics 
      in Massachusetts that will orient them to harm reduction philosophy. The training 
      is delivered online through an asynchronous platform housed at Boston University 
      School of Public Health and centers around several themes including the impact of 
      fentanyl on the drug supply, the role of harm reduction in mitigating the impacts 
      of drug criminalization, and ensuring that EMS providers have access to tools and 
      best practices for improving overdose response, pain management, documentation, 
      and respectful language. The training has been approved for Massachusetts Office 
      of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) continuing education credit and will be 
      offered for free. We plan to evaluate changes in participant knowledge and 
      attitudes and overall acceptability of the training among EMS providers in 
      Massachusetts.

TI  - Patient perspectives on emergency department initiation of medication for alcohol 
      use disorder.
PG  - 471-480
LID - 10.1111/acem.14758 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a leading cause of preventable death and 
      is a frequent diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). Treatment in the ED, 
      however, typically focuses on managing the sequelae of AUD, such as acute 
      withdrawal, rather than addressing the underlying addiction. For many patients, 
      these ED encounters are a missed opportunity to connect with medication for AUD. 
      In 2020, our ED created a pathway to offer patients with AUD treatment with 
      naltrexone (NTX) during their ED visit. The aim of this study was to identify 
      what barriers and facilitators patients perceive to NTX initiation in the ED. 
      METHODS: Adopting the theoretical framework of the behavior change wheel (BCW), 
      we conducted qualitative interviews with patients to elicit their perspectives on 
      ED initiation of NTX. Interviews were coded and analyzed using both inductive and 
      deductive approaches. Themes were categorized according to patients' 
      capabilities, opportunities, and motivations. Barriers were then mapped through 
      the BCW to design interventions that will improve our treatment pathway. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-eight patients with AUD were interviewed. Facilitators of accepting NTX 
      included having recently experienced sequelae of AUD, rapid management of 
      withdrawal symptoms by the ED provider, having a choice between intramuscular and 
      oral formulations of the medication, and experiencing positive interactions in 
      the ED that destigmatized the patient's AUD. Barriers to accepting treatment 
      included lack of provider knowledge about NTX, dependence on alcohol as 
      self-treatment for psychiatric trauma and physical pain, perceived discriminatory 
      treatment and stigma about AUD, aversion to potential side effects, and lack of 
      access to continued treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of treatment of AUD with 
      NTX in the ED is acceptable to patients and can be facilitated by knowledgeable 
      ED providers who create a destigmatizing environment, effectively manage 
      withdrawal symptoms, and connect patients to providers who will continue 
      treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: US federal policies are evolving to expand the provision of mobile 
      treatment units (MTUs) offering medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). 
      Mobile MOUD services are critical for rural areas with poor geographic access to 
      fixed-site treatment providers. This study explored willingness to utilize an MTU 
      among a sample of people who use opioids in rural Eastern Kentucky counties at 
      the epicenter of the US opioid epidemic. METHODS: The study analyzed 
      Cross-sectional survey data from the Kentucky Communities and Researchers 
      Engaging to Halt the Opioid Epidemic (CARE2HOPE) study covering five rural 
      counties in the state. Logistic regression models investigated the association 
      between willingness to utilize an MTU providing buprenorphine and naltrexone and 
      potential correlates of willingness, identified using the Behavioral Model for 
      Vulnerable Populations. RESULTS: The analytic sample comprised 174 people who 
      used opioids within the past six months. Willingness to utilize an MTU was high; 
      76.5 % of participants endorsed being willing. Those who had recently received 
      MOUD treatment, compared to those who had not received any form of treatment or 
      recovery support services, had six-fold higher odds of willingness to use an MTU. 
      However, odds of being willing to utilize an MTU were 73 % lower among those who 
      were under community supervision (e.g., parole, probation) and 81 % lower among 
      participants who experienced an overdose within the past six months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was high acceptability of MTUs offering buprenorphine and naltrexone within 
      this sample, highlighting the potential for MTUs to alleviate opioid-related 
      harms in underserved rural areas. However, the finding that people who were 
      recently under community supervision or had overdosed were significantly less 
      willing to seek mobile MOUD treatment suggest barriers (e.g., stigma) to mobile 
      MOUD at individual and systemic levels, which may prevent improving 
      opioid-related outcomes in these rural communities given their high rates of 
      criminal-legal involvement and overdose.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To examine differences in perceptions about community stigma 
      towards individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) between community members 
      involved in the opioid response (i.e., coalition members) and the general public, 
      and how community geography may moderate this relationship. METHODS: This study 
      administered identical cross-sectional surveys about perceived community 
      opioid-related stigma to two distinct populations in 66 communities participating 
      in the HEALing Communities Study prior to the intervention period (i.e., 
      coalition members, November 2019-January 2020; residents, March-April 2020). 
      Linear-mixed models compared survey responses of populations, including the 
      moderating effect of community rural/urban location. RESULTS: A total of 826 
      coalition members and 1131 residents completed the surveys. The study found no 
      differences between the coalition members and residents for general perceived 
      community opioid-related stigma. In both urban and rural communities, coalition 
      members reported greater perceived community stigma than residents reported 
      towards medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), naloxone, and drug treatment 
      as an alternative to incarceration. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest similar 
      perceived community opioid-related stigma between coalition members and 
      residents, yet differences emerge related to evidence-based practices (i.e., 
      MOUD, naloxone, and drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration) to reduce 
      opioid overdose deaths. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
      NCT04111939.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Achieving equitable access to medications for opioid use disorder 
      (MOUD) such as buprenorphine is a pressing issue. Evidence suggests disparities 
      in MOUD access based on race and socioeconomic status, further exacerbated by the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. However, the drivers behind this access gap remain poorly 
      understood. This study explores barriers to treatment access among individuals 
      with opioid use disorder (OUD) experiencing homelessness. METHODS: We interviewed 
      28 individuals in and around the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) 
      Engagement Center, an area known for its high density of active substance use and 
      homelessness. We asked about people's experiences, perceptions, and attitudes 
      toward OUD treatment. We conducted a thematic analysis of our interview data. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of participants sampled were not prescribed MOUD. 
      None of the participants reported having an active prescription of sublingual 
      buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone. White participants were more likely to 
      have been prescribed buprenorphine in the past compared to participants of other 
      races even in this socioeconomically homogeneous sample. Themes that emerged in 
      our data included challenges to accessing MOUD due to reduced services during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, lost or stolen medications, fewer inpatient withdrawal 
      management beds for women, transportation challenges, fear of adverse effects of 
      MOUD, the perception that taking MOUD replaces one addiction for another, and 
      community disapproval of MOUD. Participants also reported stigma and 
      discrimination based on race, gender, and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: 
      Systems and individual-level factors contribute to the MOUD treatment gap across 
      race and socioeconomic status. The COVID-19 pandemic posed additional access 
      challenges. This study provides important, actionable insights about the barriers 
      faced by a particularly vulnerable population of individuals with OUD 
      experiencing homelessness.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major public health threat, contributing to 
      morbidity and mortality from addiction, overdose, and related medical conditions. 
      Despite our increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology and existing medical 
      treatments of OUD, it has remained a relapsing and remitting disorder for 
      decades, with rising deaths from overdoses, rather than declining. The COVID-19 
      pandemic has accelerated the increase in overall substance use and interrupted 
      access to treatment. If increased naloxone access, more buprenorphine 
      prescribers, greater access to treatment, enhanced reimbursement, less stigma and 
      various harm reduction strategies were effective for OUD, overdose deaths would 
      not be at an all-time high. Different prevention and treatment approaches are 
      needed to reverse the concerning trend in OUD. This article will review the 
      recent trends and limitations on existing medications for OUD and briefly review 
      novel approaches to treatment that have the potential to be more durable and 
      effective than existing medications. The focus will be on promising 
      interventional treatments, psychedelics, neuroimmune, neutraceutical, and 
      electromagnetic therapies. At different phases of investigation and FDA approval, 
      these novel approaches have the potential to not just reduce overdoses and 
      deaths, but attenuate OUD, as well as address existing comorbid disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community stigma toward people with opioid use disorder (OUD) can 
      impede access to harm reduction services and treatment with medications for 
      opioid use disorder (MOUD). Such community OUD stigma is partially rooted in 
      community-level social and economic conditions, yet there remains a paucity of 
      large-scale quantitative data examining community-level factors associated with 
      OUD stigma. We examined whether rurality, social inequity, and racialized 
      segregation across communities from four states in the HEALing Communities Study 
      (HCS) were associated with 1) greater perceived community stigma toward people 
      treated for OUD, 2) greater perceived intervention stigma toward MOUD, and 3) 
      greater perceived intervention stigma toward naloxone by community stakeholders 
      in the HCS. METHODS: From November 2019-January 2020, a cross-sectional survey 
      about community OUD stigma was administered to 801 members of opioid overdose 
      prevention coalitions across 66 communities in four states prior to the start of 
      HCS intervention activities. Bivariate analyses assessed pairwise associations 
      between community rural/urban status and each of the three stigma variables, 
      using linear mixed effect modeling to account for response clustering within 
      communities, state, and respondent sociodemographic characteristics. We conducted 
      similar bivariate analyses to assess pairwise associations between racialized 
      segregation and social inequity. RESULTS: On average, the perceived community OUD 
      stigma scale score of stakeholders from rural communities was 4% higher (β=1.57, 
      SE=0.7, p≤0.05), stigma toward MOUD was 6% higher (β=0.28, SE=0.1, p≤0.05), and 
      stigma toward naloxone was 10% higher (β=0.46, SE=0.1, p≤0.01) than among 
      stakeholders from urban communities. No significant differences in the three 
      stigma variables were found among communities based on racialized segregation or 
      social inequity. CONCLUSION: Perceived community stigma toward people treated for 
      OUD, MOUD, and naloxone was higher among stakeholders in rural communities than 
      in urban communities. Findings suggest that interventions and policies to reduce 
      community-level stigma, particularly in rural areas, are warranted.

AB  - The opioid overdose epidemic continues to disproportionately impact underserved 
      rural areas throughout the nation, with many of these rural areas experiencing 
      greater opioid-related mortality rates than their urban counterparts. With 
      limited treatment infrastructure and resources, two rural communities in 
      Southeast Utah utilized community-based participatory research collaboration 
      principles to develop, implement, and evaluate a series of evidence-based 
      community opioid education events. This practical and quantitative study 
      surveying 123 participants describes the collaborative efforts of two rural 
      communities in addressing the devastating impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic 
      and reflects on the success of the events via descriptive analysis of summary 
      data. These events increased participants' reported perceptions of and knowledge 
      in four main education areas: stigma reduction, prevention and treatment 
      awareness, naloxone education and use, and resource location awareness. 
      Post-event surveys further supported these results, revealing improved learning 
      in each of these four areas, indicating increased knowledge toward opioid use 
      disorder treatments and stigma reduction. In addition, participants identified 
      key takeaways such as local resource awareness and dismantling stigma as 
      effective strategies to reduce the negative effects of the opioid overdose 
      epidemic. This model for rural community education supports previous research and 
      serves as an effective strategy of public health practice to address the opioid 
      overdose epidemic on a local level.

TI  - Factors Associated with Gaps in Naloxone Knowledge: Evidence from a 2022 Great

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of fast-acting opioids in the United States 
      suggests the increased need for non-first responder administration of naloxone. 
      Effective administration of naloxone during an overdose requires that bystanders 
      are familiar with, have access to, and know how to use naloxone. METHODS: Drawing 
      on the 2022 Nebraska Annual Social Indicators survey, we analyzed naloxone 
      familiarity, access, and competency to administer among a statewide, 
      address-based sample of Nebraskan adults. RESULTS: There were significant gaps in 
      naloxone knowledge in Nebraska. Although 75.6% of respondents were familiar with 
      naloxone, only 18.6% knew how to access naloxone and 17.6% knew how to use 
      naloxone. We find that more frequent religious service attendance is associated 
      with lower odds of naloxone familiarity. Among those familiar with naloxone, a 
      higher perception of community stigma towards opioids generally is associated 
      with lower odds of naloxone access and competency. Higher perception of community 
      stigma towards heroin, methamphetamines, and cocaine, however, is associated with 
      higher odds of naloxone access. Finally, past overdose experience, lifetime 
      illicit opioid use, being close to a person who uses opioids, and having access 
      to illicit opioids was not significantly associated with naloxone familiarity, 
      access, or competency among respondents in Nebraska's two largest cities, Omaha 
      and Lincoln. Outside of these cities, past overdose experience and access to 
      illicit opioids was associated with higher odds of naloxone access and 
      competency, but lifetime opioid use and being close to a person who uses opioids 
      had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the continued need for 
      education on naloxone with a specific focus on access and competency to further 
      reduce opioid-related overdose deaths. Education campaigns targeted at places of 
      worship or individuals close to people who use opioids may further serve those 
      with a lower likelihood of naloxone familiarity and promote knowledge of naloxone 
      among those with higher odds of encountering an overdose. Further work is needed 
      to understand differences in the relationship between substance-specific 
      perceived stigma and its association with naloxone access.

AB  - The United States continues to be impacted by decades of an opioid misuse 
      epidemic, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the growing prevalence of 
      highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSO) such as fentanyl. In instances of a 
      toxicity event, first-response administration of reversal medications such as 
      naloxone can be insufficient to fully counteract the effects of HPSO, 
      particularly when there is co-occurring substance use. In an effort to 
      characterize and study this multi-faceted problem, the Camden Opioid Research 
      Initiative (CORI) has been formed. The CORI study has collected and analyzed 
      post-mortem toxicology data from 42 cases of decedents who expired from 
      opioid-related toxicity in the South New Jersey region to characterize substance 
      use profiles. Co-occurring substance use, whether by intent or through possible 
      contamination of the illicit opioid supply, is pervasive among deaths due to 
      opioid toxicity, and evidence of medication-assisted treatment is scarce. Nearly 
      all (98%) of the toxicology cases show the presence of the HPSO, fentanyl, and 
      very few (7%) results detected evidence of medication-assisted treatment for 
      opioid use disorder, such as buprenorphine or methadone, at the time of death. 
      The opioid toxicity reversal drug, naloxone, was detected in 19% of cases, but 
      100% of cases expressed one or more stimulants, and sedatives including xylazine 
      were detected in 48% of cases. These results showing complex substance use 
      profiles indicate that efforts at mitigating the opioid misuse epidemic must 
      address the complications presented by co-occurring stimulant and other substance 
      use, and reduce barriers to and stigmas of seeking effective medication-assisted 
      treatments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examine "objective" 
      indicators of safety and efficacy of investigational drugs, participants may not 
      perceive study medications as neutral entities. Some medications are imbued with 
      social and cultural meaning, such as stigmatized medications for opioid use 
      disorders. Such perceptions surrounding substance use treatments can extend to 
      the research context and shape RCT participants' experiences with and adherence 
      to study medications. METHODS: Considering these complexities in substance use 
      research, we conducted a nested qualitative study within a multi-site, pragmatic 
      RCT in Canada testing two treatments (methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone) 
      for opioid use disorder. Between 2017 and 2020, we conducted 115 interviews with 
      75 RCT participants across five trial sites in British Columbia, Alberta, 
      Ontario, and Quebec. RESULTS: Using an abductive coding approach, we 
      characterized participants by their previous experience with medication for 
      opioid use disorder and by their exposure to drug culture and drug scenes. Across 
      these experience types, we identified systematic differences around participants' 
      perceptions of the study medications, sources of information and expertise, and 
      medication stigma. CONCLUSION: Our findings illustrate the critical importance of 
      social context in shaping medication beliefs and study experiences among people 
      who use drugs, with implications for the conduct of future RCTs in substance use.

TI  - "That's why we're speaking up today": exploring barriers to overdose fatality 
      prevention in Indianapolis' Black community with semi-structured interviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose deaths are of great concern to public health, with 
      over one million lives lost since 1999. While many efforts have been made to 
      mitigate these, Black communities continue to experience a greater burden of 
      fatalities than their white counterparts. This study aims to explore why by 
      working with Black community members in Indianapolis through semi-structured 
      interviews. METHODS: Semi-structured one-on-one in-depth interviews were 
      conducted in spring and summer of 2023 with Black residents (N = 23) of zip codes 
      46202, 46205, 46208, and 46218 in Indianapolis. Ten interview questions were used 
      to facilitate conversations about opioid overdoses, recovery, fatality prevention 
      tools such as calling 911 and naloxone, law enforcement, and racism. Data were 
      analyzed using grounded theory and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Interviews 
      revealed access barriers and intervention opportunities. Racism was present in 
      both. Mental access barriers such as stigma, fear, and mistrust contributed to 
      practical barriers such as knowledge of how to administer naloxone. Racism 
      exacerbated mental barriers by adding the risk of race-based mistreatment to 
      consequences related to association with substance use. Participants discussed 
      the double stigma of substance use and being Black, fear of being searched in law 
      enforcement encounters and what would happen if law enforcement found naloxone on 
      them, and mistrust of law enforcement and institutions that provide medical 
      intervention. Participants had favorable views of interventions that incorporated 
      mutual aid and discussed ideas for future interventions that included this 
      framework. CONCLUSIONS: Racism exacerbates Blacks' mental access barriers (i.e., 
      help-seeking barriers), which, in turn, contribute to practical barriers, such as 
      calling 911 and administering naloxone. Information and resources coming from 
      people within marginalized communities tend to be trusted. Leveraging 
      inter-community relationships may increase engagement in opioid overdose fatality 
      prevention. Interventions and resources directed toward addressing opioid 
      overdose fatalities in Black communities should use mutual aid frameworks to 
      increase the utilization of the tools they provide.

TI  - Lessons Learned from Developing Tailored Community Communication Campaigns in the 
      HEALing Communities Study.
PG  - 699-705
LID - 10.1080/10810730.2023.2262948 [doi]
AB  - This paper outlines lessons learned from tailoring communication campaigns to 
      increase demand for, and reduce stigma toward, evidence-based practices to reduce 
      opioid overdose deaths in 66 communities participating in the HEALing (Helping to 
      End Addiction Long-term(SM)) Communities Study (HCS). We present nine lessons 
      gathered about how to engage local communities in both virtual and in-person 
      opioid messaging and distribution between February 2019 and June 2022. The 
      research team created four communication campaigns and did extensive, tailored 
      marketing and promotion to assist communities in implementing evidence-based 
      clinical activities to reduce opioid overdose mortality. Various strategies and 
      venues were used to amplify HCS messages, using free and paid outlets for message 
      distribution, focusing primarily on social media due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Increasing the availability of medications for opioid use disorder and naloxone, 
      as HCS attempted, is not enough; getting people to accept and use them depends on 
      communication efforts. This paper focuses on the process of preparing communities 
      for communication campaign activities, which we hope can help guide other 
      communities preparing for opioid or substance-related campaigns in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined perceived substance use, opioid knowledge, and 
      barriers to Black people accessing treatment for substance and opioid use 
      disorder (SUD/OUD). METHODS: Thirty-nine participants completed the community 
      survey and The Brief Opioid Overdose Knowledge questionnaire. Qualitative 
      interviews were conducted with 18 stakeholders and 9 people with SUD/OUD. 
      FINDINGS: Out of 39 participants, <50 % knew where to refer someone for treatment 
      and fewer knew where to access naloxone. Majority of the stakeholders and people 
      with SUD/OUD reported stigma as a treatment barrier. CONCLUSION: Studies related 
      to provider anti-stigma trainings and psychoeducation for Black people living in 
      the rural South are warranted.

TI  - Temporal Reinforcement of Naloxone Training Results in Significant Retention of 
      Anti-bias and Overdose-Response Knowledge.
PG  - e45415
LID - 10.7759/cureus.45415 [doi]
LID - e45415
AB  - BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic is an increasingly severe problem affecting 
      public health and leading to significant economic burdens on healthcare systems. 
      Overdose reversal training and de-stigmatization efforts are common strategies 
      used to combat this epidemic. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals report a 
      lack of confidence in administering naloxone and high stigmatization levels 
      toward people with opioid use disorder (OUD). While one-time educational training 
      reduces stigma and improves naloxone administration confidence, we previously 
      demonstrated that knowledge retention at a three-month follow-up is reduced 
      among a cohort of medical students. This study aimed to improve the effectiveness 
      of opioid overdose awareness and reversal training (OOART) with a three-month 
      follow-up abbreviated OOART (aOOART) booster video. METHODS: Voluntary OOART was 
      offered to first-year medical students (M1) at the Drexel University College of 
      Medicine in 2022. At this training, 82 students completed a pre-training survey 
      to establish a baseline knowledge and attitude toward people with OUD and their 
      familiarity with the steps to reverse an opioid overdose. Following the hour-long 
      training, 64 of 82 (79%) participants completed the post-training survey to 
      measure the immediate retention of training information. After 2.5 months, 
      students were randomly selected to receive a 6.5-minute aOOART booster video or 
      serve as an unboosted control. Students in the booster and non-booster cohorts 
      then completed a three-month follow-up survey. RESULTS:  Students who received 
      the aOOART booster had significantly increased opioid reversal knowledge scores 
      compared to non-boosted control students at the three-month follow-up. The aOOART 
      booster resulted in a retention of the lowered stigma, and participants expressed 
      a higher willingness to respond to an opioid overdose compared to participants 
      who did not receive the booster video at the three-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
       This study shows that an aOOART booster method improves knowledge retention 
      following initial OOART. Further, the aOOART booster video served to maintain 
      participants' reduced stigma toward people with OUD and maintained participants' 
      willingness to respond to an opioid overdose. These results support the 
      incorporation of an abbreviated, periodic OOART reinforcement video into opioid 
      overdose response training nationwide. We believe this "booster video" approach 
      is a novel and effective method to improve healthcare professionals' and medical 
      student preparedness to render appropriate care to people with OUD.

TI  - Overview of Alcohol Use Disorder.
PG  - 565-572
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.20230488 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol is regularly consumed throughout most of the world, including by nearly 
      half the U.S. population age 12 or older. Heavy drinking, which is also common, 
      contributes to multiple adverse medical, psychiatric, and social outcomes and 
      more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is the major risk 
      factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), whose current U.S. prevalence is 11%. 
      However, AUD is undertreated, with less than 15% of individuals with a lifetime 
      diagnosis receiving any treatment. Risk of AUD is nearly equally genetic and 
      environmental. AUD is responsive to psychosocial treatments, including 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol 
      affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus pharmacotherapy for AUD is 
      also effective. The three medications approved in the United States to treat 
      AUD-disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and 
      acamprosate-are underprescribed, despite being considered first-line treatments 
      in clinical practice guidelines. Two medications not approved for treating AUD, 
      topiramate and gabapentin, have shown efficacy in treating the disorder and are 
      used off-label. Recent studies of novel drug candidates, including psychedelics 
      and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are promising additions for the treatment of 
      AUD, although they require further evaluation before being used clinically. 
      Despite the growing availability of efficacious psychosocial and pharmacological 
      treatments for AUD, it remains a highly stigmatized condition. Research aimed at 
      enhancing the identification and treatment of AUD, including precision 
      therapeutics, could broaden the acceptability of AUD treatment, benefiting 
      affected individuals and their families and reducing the stigma associated with 
      the disorder.

TI  - Use of nonstigmatizing language is associated with improved outcomes in 
      hospitalized people who inject drugs.
PG  - 670-676
LID - 10.1002/jhm.13146 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stigma surrounding opioid use disorder (OUD) is a barrier to 
      treatment. The use of stigmatizing language may be evidence of negative views 
      toward patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify associations between language 
      and clinical outcomes in patients admitted for infectious complications of OUD. 
      DESIGNS: We performed a retrospective medical record review. SETTINGS AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Four U.S. academic health systems. Participants were patients with 
      OUD admitted for infectious complications of injection opioid use from January 1, 
      2018, to December 31, 2018, identified through international classification of 
      diseases, 10th revision codes consistent with OUD and acute bacterial/fungal 
      infection. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Discharge summaries were reviewed for 
      language, specifically: abuse, addiction, dependence, misuse, use disorder, 
      intravenous drug use, and others. Binary outcomes including medication for OUD, 
      planned discharge, naloxone provision, and an OUD treatment plan were evaluated 
      using logistic regressions and admission duration was evaluated using Gamma 
      regression. RESULTS: A total of 1285 records were reviewed and 328 met inclusion 
      criteria. Of those, 191 (58%) were male, with a median age of 38 years. The most 
      common term was "abuse" (219, 67%), whereas "use disorder" was recorded in 75 
      (23%) records. Having "use disorder" in the discharge summary was associated with 
      increased odds of having a documented plan for ongoing OUD treatment (adjusted 
      odds ratio [AOR]: 4.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89-8.93) and having a 
      documented plan for addiction-specific follow-up care (AOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 
      1.30-4.09). CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing language was common in this study of 
      patients hospitalized for infectious complications of OUD. Best-practice language 
      was uncommon, but when used was associated with increased odds of addiction 
      treatment and specialty care referrals.

TI  - Stigma by Association: To what Extent is the Attitude Toward Naloxone Affected by 
      the Stigma of Opioid Use Disorder?
PG  - 941-952
LID - 10.1177/08971900221097173 [doi]
AB  - The United States opioid epidemic is fueled by illicit opioid abuse and 
      prescription opioid misuse and abuse. Consequently, cases of opioid use disorder 
      (OUD, opioid addiction), opioid overdose, and related deaths have increased since 
      the year 2000. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses opioid 
      intoxication to prevent death from overdose. It is one of the major risk 
      mitigation strategies recommended in the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. However, despite 
      the exponential increase in dispensing and distribution of naloxone, opioid 
      overdose and related deaths have continued to increase; suggesting that the 
      increased naloxone supply still lags the need. This discordance is attributed at 
      least in part to the negative attitude toward naloxone, which is based on the 
      belief that naloxone is only meant for "addicts" and "abusers" (OUD patients). 
      This negative attitude or so-called naloxone stigma is therefore considered a 
      major barrier for naloxone distribution and consequently, overdose-death 
      prevention efforts. This article presents evidence that challenges common 
      assertions about OUD stigma being the sole and direct driving force behind 
      naloxone stigma, and the purported magnitude of the barrier that naloxone stigma 
      constitutes for naloxone distribution programs among the stakeholders (patients, 
      pharmacists, and prescribers). The case was then made to operationalize and 
      quantify the construct among the stakeholders to determine the extent to which 
      OUD stigma drives naloxone stigma, and the relative impact of naloxone stigma as 
      a barrier for naloxone distribution efforts.

TI  - Project lifeline: implementing SBIRT in rural pharmacies to address opioid 
      overdoses and substance use disorder.
PG  - 406-417
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2023.2185891 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is emerging recognition of the unique benefits of implementing 
      screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in pharmacy 
      settings to identify patients who can benefit from services and connecting them 
      to those services.Objectives: This study describes Project Lifeline - a 
      multipronged public health initiative to provide educational and technical 
      support to rural community pharmacies implementing SBIRT for substance use 
      disorder (SUD) and providing harm reduction support.Methods: Eight community 
      pharmacies were recruited. Patients receiving a Schedule II prescription were 
      invited to engage in SBIRT and offered naloxone. Patient screening data and key 
      informant interviews with pharmacy staff on implementation strategy were 
      analyzed.Results: Between 2018-2020, 4,601 adult patients were offered screens 
      and 3,407 screens were completed on 2,881 unique adult patients (51.3% female; 
      <0.01% nonbinary; 95.7% White). Of these unique screens, 107 patients were 
      indicated for brief intervention, 31 accepted the brief intervention; and 12 were 
      given a referral to SUD treatment. Patients who declined SBIRT or who did not 
      want to reduce their use were offered access to naloxone (n = 372). Key informant 
      interviews highlighted the importance of person-centered staff education, 
      role-playing, anti-stigma training, and integrating activities into existing 
      patient-care processes.Conclusion: While ongoing research is needed to 
      characterize the full impact of Project Lifeline on patient outcomes, the 
      reported findings help reinforce the benefits of multipronged public health 
      initiatives that include community pharmacists to address the SUD crisis.

TI  - The eliminate hepatitis C (EC) experience study: baseline characteristics of a 
      cohort of people who inject drugs in Melbourne, Australia.
PG  - e071665

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Direct-acting antivirals provide an opportunity to eliminate 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a public health threat in Australia, yet barriers to 
      care remain. In this study, we use baseline data from a longitudinal cohort of 
      people who inject drugs to understand differences in participant characteristics 
      and explore experiences of stigma, health service utilisation and health literacy 
      between three care cascade groups. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community 
      and private primary healthcare services in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Participants completed baseline surveys between 19 September 2018 and 15 December 
      2020. We recruited 288 participants; the median age was 42 years (IQR: 37-49 
      years) and 198 (69%) were male. At baseline, 103 (36%) self-reported being 'not 
      engaged in testing', 127 (44%) had HCV RNA positivity but were 'not engaged in 
      treatment' and 58 (20%) were 'engaged in HCV treatment'. OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Descriptive statistics were used to present the baseline demographics, health 
      service utilisation and experiences of stigma data. We explored differences in 
      these scales between participant demographics using χ(2) test or fisher's exact 
      tests, and differences between health literacy scores using one-way analysis of 
      variance tests. RESULTS: A majority were in regular contact with multiple health 
      services, and most had previously been identified as at-risk of HCV. In the 12 
      months preceding baseline, 70% reported any experiences of stigma related to 
      injecting drug use. Assessment of health literacy data identified gaps for those 
      'not engaged in testing' and 'not engaged in treatment' across two relevant 
      domains: 'ability to appraise health information' and 'ability to actively engage 
      with healthcare providers'. CONCLUSION: In eliminate hepatitis C experience, 
      lower HCV testing and treatment may be explained by experiences of stigmatisation 
      or gaps in health literacy. Enhanced interventions targeting people who inject 
      drugs to promote HCV care are needed.

TI  - The Opioid Overdose Resuscitation Education for Addiction Counselors and Trainees 
      (Opioid Overdose REACT) naloxone response education pilot project improved 
      confidence and knowledge among addiction counselors and trainees.
PG  - 509-517
LID - 10.1080/15563650.2023.2229508 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Community programs to teach nonmedical laypeople how to recognize 
      an opioid overdose and effectively resuscitate the victim using naloxone have 
      proliferated recently as a significant component of harm-reduction efforts. 
      Although many such programs target laypeople like first responders or friends and 
      family members of people who use drugs, there are currently no programs that 
      specifically target addiction counselors, despite their work with a client 
      population at high risk of an opioid overdose. METHODS: The four-hour curriculum 
      designed by the authors covered opioid agonist and antagonist pharmacology; 
      opioid toxidrome signs; legal implications and indications for using the naloxone 
      kits; and hands-on training. Participants were two cohorts of addiction 
      counselors and addiction counseling trainees at our institution and an affiliated 
      Opioid Treatment Program methadone clinic. Surveys testing participant knowledge 
      and confidence were conducted at baseline, immediately post-training, six months 
      post-training, and 12 months post-training. RESULTS: Overall, opioid and naloxone 
      pharmacology knowledge, as well as the confidence to intervene in an overdose 
      emergency, improved among participants in both cohorts. Knowledge scores at 
      baseline (n = 36, median 5/10) improved significantly immediately post-training 
      (n = 31, median 7/10, P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and were sustained 
      six (n = 19) and 12 months (n = 11) later. Two participants reported using their 
      naloxone kits to successfully reverse a client overdose in the 12 months after 
      taking the course. DISCUSSION: These results from our knowledge translation pilot 
      project suggest that our educational program to train addiction counselors in 
      opioid pharmacology and toxicology, allowing them to recognize and respond to an 
      opioid overdose, is feasible and could be effective. Specific barriers to 
      implementing such educational programs include cost, stigma, and unclear best 
      practice for designing and conducting these programs. CONCLUSIONS: Further study 
      of providing opioid pharmacology education and overdose and naloxone training to 
      addiction counselors and counseling trainees appears to be warranted.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators of naloxone and safe injection facility interventions 
      to reduce opioid drug-related deaths: A qualitative analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid drug-related deaths continue to be a significant public health 
      concern in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI). While both 
      regions have implemented naloxone to reduce drug related deaths, there remains a 
      gap in the implementation of a supervised injection facility (SIF). This study 
      aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing naloxone and a SIF to 
      reduce opioid drug-related deaths in ROI and NI. METHODS: Semi-structured 
      interviews (n=23) were conducted in ROI and NI with experts by experience (n=8), 
      staff from low threshold services (n=9), and individuals involved in policy 
      making (n= 6). Data were analyzed using coding reliability Thematic Analysis and 
      were informed by the Risk Environmental Framework. RESULTS: The findings 
      illustrated that stigma within the media, health centers, and the community was a 
      significant barrier to naloxone distribution and SIF implementation. Policing and 
      community intimidation were reported to hinder naloxone carriage in both the ROI 
      and NI, while threats of paramilitary violence towards people who use drugs were 
      unique to NI. Municipal government delays and policy maker apathy were reported 
      to hinder SIF implementation in the ROI. Participants suggested peer-to-peer 
      naloxone delivery and amending legislation to facilitate non-prescription 
      naloxone would increase naloxone uptake. Participants recommended using webinars, 
      Town Halls, and a Citizens' Assembly as tools to advocate for SIF implementation. 
      CONCLUSION: Local and regional stigma reduction campaigns are needed in 
      conjunction with policy changes to advance naloxone and a SIF. Tailoring stigma 
      campaigns to incorporate the lived experience of people who use drugs, their 
      family members, and the general community can aid in educating the public and 
      change negative perceptions. This study highlights the need for ongoing efforts 
      to reduce stigma and increase accessibility to evidence-based interventions to 
      address opioid drug-related deaths in the ROI, NI, and internationally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on women who inject drugs is scarce in low- and 
      middle-income countries. Women experience unique harms such as sexism and sexual 
      violence which translate into negative health outcomes. The present work aims to 
      provide insight into the experiences of women who inject drugs at the US-Mexico 
      border to identify social and health-related risk factors for overdose to guide 
      harm reduction interventions across the Global South. METHODS: We recruited 25 
      women ≥ 18 years of age accessing harm reduction and sexual health services at a 
      non-governmental harm reduction organization, "Verter", in Mexicali, Mexico. We 
      employed purposeful sampling to recruit women who inject drugs who met 
      eligibility criteria. We collected quantitative survey data and in-depth 
      interview data. Analyses of both data sources involved the examination of 
      descriptive statistics and thematic analysis, respectively, and were guided by 
      the syndemic and continuum of overdose risk frameworks. RESULTS: Survey data 
      demonstrated reports of initiating injection drug use at a young age, 
      experiencing homelessness, engaging in sex work, being rejected by family 
      members, experiencing physical violence, injecting in public spaces, and 
      experiencing repeated overdose events. Interview data provided evidence of stigma 
      and discrimination toward women, a lack of safe spaces and support systems, risk 
      of overdose-related harms, sexual violence, and the overall need for harm 
      reduction services. CONCLUSION: Women who inject drugs in Mexicali describe 
      experiences of violence, overdose, and public injecting. Women are particularly 
      vulnerable in the Mexicali context, as this area faces a noticeable lack of 
      health and social services. Evidenced-based harm reduction strategies such as 
      safe consumption sites and overdose prevention strategies (e.g., naloxone 
      distribution and training) may benefit this population. Evidence from local 
      organizations could help close the gap in service provision in low-resource 
      settings like Mexico, where government action is almost nonexistent.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study examines social service clinicians' (SSCs) perspectives 
      of factors within the criminal justice system that impact justice-involved 
      individuals' use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Opioid use 
      disorder (OUD) rates are high among justice-involved individuals, and overdose 
      risk is heightened upon release from incarceration. This study is innovative, as 
      it specifically focuses on criminal justice contexts that influence the MOUD 
      continuum of care from the perspective of clinicians working within the criminal 
      justice system. Understanding criminal justice-related facilitators and barriers 
      to MOUD treatment will guide tailored policy intervention to increase MOUD use 
      and promote recovery and remission among justice-involved individuals. METHODS: 
      The study completed qualitative interviews with 25 SSCs who are employed by a 
      state department of corrections to provide assessment and referrals to substance 
      use treatment to individuals on community supervision. The study used NVivo 
      software to code the major themes found within each transcribed interview; two 
      research assistants participated in consensus coding to ensure consistency in 
      coding across transcripts. This study focused on the secondary codes that fell 
      under the "Criminal Justice System" primary code, as well as codes that indicated 
      barriers and facilitators to MOUD treatment. RESULTS: SSCs cited sentencing time 
      credits as structural facilitators of MOUD treatment; clients sought more 
      information about extended-release naltrexone since time off of their sentence 
      was available if initiated. Support for extended-release naltrexone by officers 
      and judges was often mentioned as an attitudinal facilitator of initiation. Poor 
      intra-agency collaboration among department of corrections agents was an 
      institutional barrier to MOUD. Also, probation and parole officers' stigma 
      surrounding other types of MOUD, specifically buprenorphine and methadone, was an 
      attitudinal barrier to MOUD within the criminal justice system. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Future research should examine the effect that time credits have on 
      extended-release naltrexone initiation, considering the wide consensus among SSCs 
      that their clients were motivated to initiate this type of MOUD because of the 
      resulting time off their sentences. Stigma among probation and parole officers 
      and lack of communication within the criminal justice system need to be addressed 
      so that more individuals with OUD may be exposed to life-saving treatments.

      Integrative Review of Best Practices.
PG  - 18-24

AB  - More than 20 million people in the United States have a substance use disorder 
      (SUD), increasing their risk for overdose (OD). Patients arriving to emergency 
      departments (EDs) with OD typically require lifesaving interventions, but 
      inconsistencies exist regarding further intervention and discharge instructions. 
      The purpose of the current integrative review was to determine best care 
      practices for patients presenting to EDs with an illicit drug OD. A literature 
      search included the databases PubMed, EBSCO Host, ProQuest Health and Medicine, 
      and Google Scholar. Thirty-five articles outlined interventions for SUD/OD 
      initiated in EDs; most for opioid OD. Best practice intervention components 
      included psychiatric evaluations, SUD screening tools, buprenorphine initiation, 
      naloxone distribution and training, OD prevention education, referrals to 
      medication-assisted treatment, and harm reduction strategies. Barriers to 
      implementation included legislation, insurance/costs, community resource 
      availability, staffing, training, and potential stigma. With myriad approaches, 
      nurses with SUD care experience can advocate for instituting best practices for 
      patients in the ED and upon discharge. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and 
      Mental Health Services, 61(6), 18-24.].

TI  - Considerations for the design of overdose education and naloxone distribution 
      interventions: results of a multi-stakeholder workshop.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Opioid overdose epidemic is a public health crisis that is 
      impacting communities around the world. Overdose education and naloxone 
      distribution programs equip and train lay people to respond in the event of an 
      overdose. We aimed to understand factors to consider for the design of naloxone 
      distribution programs in point-of-care settings from the point of view of 
      community stakeholders. METHODS: We hosted a multi-stakeholder co-design workshop 
      to elicit suggestions for a naloxone distribution program. We recruited people 
      with lived experience of opioid overdose, community representatives, and other 
      stakeholders from family practice, emergency medicine, addictions medicine, and 
      public health to participate in a full-day facilitated co-design discussion 
      wherein large and small group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed and 
      analysed using thematic approaches. RESULTS: A total of twenty-four participants 
      participated in the multi-stakeholder workshop from five stakeholder groups 
      including geographic and setting diversity. Collaborative dialogue and shared 
      storytelling revealed seven considerations for the design of naloxone 
      distribution programs specific to training needs and the provision of naloxone, 
      these are: recognizing overdose, how much naloxone, impact of stigma, legal risk 
      of responding, position as conventional first aid, friends and family as 
      responders, support to call 911. CONCLUSION: To create an naloxone distribution 
      program in emergency departments, family practice and substance use treatment 
      services, stigma is a central design consideration for training and naloxone 
      kits. Design choices that reference the iconography, type, and form of materials 
      associated with first aid have the potential to satisfy the need to de-stigmatize 
      overdose response.

      Online Forum Posts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intentional or accidental drug-overdose is a leading cause of 
      mortality in U.S. women of child-bearing age. Opioid use during pregnancy is not 
      only associated with maternal overdose, but with low birth weight at term and 
      neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Buprenorphine was approved as a medication 
      for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the United States in 2002 and is for many 
      women, a preferred treatment option versus methadone. Buprenorphine is relatively 
      safe during pregnancy and is associated with lower rates of NAS than methadone. 
      Given the importance of MOUD during pregnancy, relatively little information 
      exists regarding patients' questions and concerns about buprenorphine treatment, 
      including the psychological challenges they face. AIMS: The purpose of the study 
      was to describe the perinatal concerns of women with opioid use disorder who 
      posted to an online suboxone forum. METHODS: Qualitative descriptive design to 
      analyze some 170 posts from mothers with OUD to an online Suboxone(®) support 
      forum over the period 2016-2021. RESULTS: The analysis of the interview data 
      revealed 4 important themes: (a) Stigma resulting in self-deprecation, low 
      self-esteem, and low self-efficacy; (b) stigma from family members and loved 
      ones; (c) stigma from the medical profession; and (d) stigma from the community 
      at-large (social stigma). CONCLUSIONS: There is compelling evidence to emphasize 
      the importance of open communication and support between medical personnel and 
      patients to ensure optimal outcomes for mother and baby.

TI  - Exploring patient experience and satisfaction with depot buprenorphine 
      formulations: A mixed-methods study.
PG  - 791-802
LID - 10.1111/dar.13616 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The introduction of depot buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid 
      dependence allows for reduced dosing frequency compared with conventional 
      treatments, such as oral methadone and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone. Reduced 
      dosing frequency is perceived to reduce issues such as high out-of-pocket costs, 
      frequent attendance to pharmacies, stigmatisation and the risk of diversion for 
      unsanctioned opioid use. This study aims to explore the experiences of patients 
      receiving depot buprenorphine from an Australian publicly operated drug and 
      alcohol service. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the service over a 
      5-week period in 2021. Twenty-eight participants consented to be involved in a 
      mixed methods quantitative verbal survey and qualitative interview process. 
      RESULTS: The majority of participants reported satisfaction with depot 
      buprenorphine across the domains of efficacy, convenience and global 
      satisfaction. Participants perceived benefits as increased convenience, reduced 
      stigmatisation and the inability to 'skip' daily Medication Assisted Treatment 
      for Opioid Dependence (MATOD) doses. There were mixed experiences with the 
      ability for depot buprenorphine to 'hold' participants throughout the dosing 
      interval. Reduced contact and disconnection from healthcare services were 
      reported as an issue for some participants when initiating depot buprenorphine. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patient perceptions of depot buprenorphine appear to 
      be deeply rooted in prior experience with 'conventional' MATOD treatments. Depot 
      buprenorphine is seen to be beneficial socially, personally, and financially by 
      the majority of patients interviewed. The potential for disconnection from 
      services and mixed experiences of efficacy throughout the dosing period may 
      negatively influence patient experience.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While public health measures including physical distancing and 
      stay-at-home orders have clear benefits in COVID-19 mitigation and prevention, 
      they have provided unique challenges for individuals with substance use disorder 
      (SUD), including Treatment Court (TC) participants. METHODS: This study involved 
      a qualitative evaluation of TC Family Nights; one series of Family Nights was 
      conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and the second series was adapted and held 
      remotely due to COVID-19 distancing requirements. RESULTS: Several important 
      themes emerged, including general positive experiences, accessible session 
      logistics, naloxone training, attention to stigma, building recovery capital, 
      group engagement, social interaction, and community action. These themes will 
      help inform future SUD recovery education. CONCLUSION: Online recovery support 
      events provide a new model for courts and recovery organizations that seek 
      multiple ways to provide connection and support for their participants and 
      families during times when accessibility is prioritized, in-person activities are 
      discouraged, and in resource-sparse and geographically isolated communities.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to implementing medications for opioid use disorder and 
      naloxone distribution in Veterans Affairs emergency departments.
PG  - 289-298
LID - 10.1111/acem.14683 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Safer opioid prescribing patterns, naloxone distribution, and 
      medications for opioid use disorder (M-OUD) are an important part of decreasing 
      opioid-related adverse events. Veterans are more likely to experience these 
      adverse events compared to the general population. Despite treatment guidelines 
      and ED-based opioid safety programs implemented throughout Veterans Affairs (VA) 
      Medical Centers, many Veterans with OUD do not receive these harm reduction 
      interventions. Prior research in other health care settings has identified 
      barriers to M-OUD initiation and naloxone distribution; however, little is known 
      about how this may be similar or different for health care professionals in VA ED 
      and urgent care centers. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with VA 
      health care professionals and staff using a semistructured interview guide. We 
      analyzed the data addressing barriers and facilitators to M-OUD treatment in the 
      ED and naloxone distribution using descriptive matrix analysis, followed by team 
      consensus. RESULTS: We interviewed 19 VA staff in various roles. Respondent 
      concerns and considerations regarding the initiation of M-OUD in the ED included 
      M-OUD initiation falling outside of ED's scope of providing acute treatment, lack 
      of VA-approved M-OUD protocols and follow-up procedures, staffing concerns, and 
      educational gaps. Respondents reported that naloxone was important but lacked 
      clarity on who should prescribe it. Some respondents stated that an automated 
      system to prescribe naloxone would be helpful, and others felt that it would not 
      offer needed support and education to patients. Some respondents reported that 
      naloxone would not address opioid misuse, which other respondents felt was a 
      belief due to stigma around substance use and lack of education about treatment 
      options. CONCLUSIONS: Our VA-based research highlights similarities of barriers 
      and facilitators, seen in other health care settings, when implementing opioid 
      safety initiatives. Education and training, destigmatizing substance use disorder 
      care, and leveraging technology are important facilitators to increasing access 
      to lifesaving therapies for OUD treatment and harm reduction.

TI  - A mixed-methods analysis of risk-reduction strategies adopted by syringe services 
      program participants and non-syringe services program participants in New York 
      City.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of fentanyl in the drug market, syringe services 
      programs (SSPs) have been at the forefront of providing life-saving tools such as 
      naloxone and fentanyl test strips to people who use drugs (PWUD). It is still 
      unclear, however, how the adoption of risk-reduction practices has differed among 
      PWUD in the context of increasing presence of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl in the 
      drug supply. This study aims to assess the adoption of risk-reduction tools 
      (e.g., naloxone) among those engaged with SSP services and those not engaged with 
      SSP services. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study following a convergent 
      parallel design integrating both quantitative and qualitative data. Interviews 
      were conducted with 80 people who used street opioids (i.e., heroin or opioid 
      pills not prescribed), 32 of whom were not engaged in SSP services. Quantitative 
      differences between those engaged and those not engaged in SSPs were assessed 
      using independent samples t tests and Fisher's exact tests. A thematic analytic 
      approach was employed to compare qualitative responses between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: Three main themes emerged in our analysis: (1) Both groups expressed an 
      interest in fentanyl test strips (FTS), but those engaged in SSP services found 
      them to be more accessible; (2) there was greater adoption of and enthusiasm for 
      naloxone among SSP participants; and (3) SSP participants were more likely to 
      have or be interested in having someone check in on them when using alone, but 
      stigma and perceived personal risk of overdose prevented widespread adoption of 
      this practice among all participants. CONCLUSION: SSPs provide a vital function 
      by facilitating naloxone and FTS distribution to participants who often have 
      little control over their exposure to fentanyl. However, stigma and 
      misconceptions regarding drug use are barriers to people adopting risk-reduction 
      practices, particularly among those not engaged with SSPs.

TI  - Patients' perceptions of self-administered dosing to opioid agonist treatment and 
      other changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study.
PG  - e069857
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069857 [doi]
LID - e069857
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, addiction treatment services received 
      official guidance asking them to limit face-to-face contact with patients and to 
      prescribe opioid agonist treatment (OAT) medication flexibly. With the aim for 
      most patients to receive take-home supplies for self-administration rather than 
      attendance for observed daily dosing. DESIGN: This was a theory-driven, 
      clinically applied qualitative study, with data for thematic analysis collected 
      by semi-structured, audio-recorded, telephone interviews. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Twenty-seven adults (aged ≥18 years) enrolled in sublingual (tablet) 
      buprenorphine and oral (liquid) methadone OAT. SETTING: Community addictions 
      centre in the London Borough of Lambeth operated by South London and Maudsley NHS 
      Trust. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: (1) dissatisfaction and 
      perceived stigma with OAT medication dispensing arrangements before the pandemic; 
      (2) positive adaptations in response to COVID-19 by services; (3) participants 
      recommended that, according to preference and evidence of adherence, OAT should 
      be personalised to offer increasing medication supplies for self-administration 
      from as early as 7 days after commencement of maintenance prescribing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In an applied qualitative study of patients enrolled in OAT during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, participants endorsed their opportunity to take medication 
      themselves at home and with virtual addiction support. Most patients described a 
      preference for self-administration with increased dispensing supplies, from as 
      early as 7 days into maintenance treatment, if they could demonstrate adherence 
      to their prescription.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Illinois Naloxone Standing Order allows community pharmacists to 
      dispense naloxone; however, this policy initiative may be underutilized. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to characterize naloxone dispensing barriers, overall 
      and by pharmacy type, make recommendations that can inform future policies to 
      improve naloxone access, and evaluate outreach initiative effectiveness from 
      academic detailers' perspectives. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis 
      of semistructured data collected as part of an educational outreach program 
      targeting Illinois community pharmacists in 2021. Academic detailers conducted 
      educational outreach visits across community pharmacy settings (i.e., primary 
      pharmacy, grocery pharmacy, or independent pharmacy) to promote standing order 
      use and discuss barriers pharmacists face when dispensing naloxone. Following 
      each visit, detailers recorded visit characteristics, pharmacist-identified 
      obstacles impacting naloxone dispensing, and visit effectiveness. RESULTS: 
      Detailers performed in-person visits at 270 (78%) of 348 targeted sites. A lower 
      proportion of independent pharmacies (61%) routinely stock naloxone than primary 
      (95%, P < 0.001) or grocery (98%, P < 0.001) pharmacies. Among pharmacists at 
      independent pharmacies, 43% indicated they were highly or extremely comfortable 
      dispensing naloxone, a significantly lower proportion than pharmacists at grocery 
      (79%, P < 0.001) or primary (68%, P < 0.001) pharmacies. The prevalence of 
      salient barriers to naloxone dispensing was: cost/insurance issues (primary 
      pharmacy = 38% vs. grocery pharmacy = 36% vs. independent pharmacy = 28%, P = 
      0.46), stigma (36% vs. 49% vs. 16%, P < 0.05), and lack of standing order 
      enrollment (0% vs. 0% vs. 49%, P < 0.05). On average, detailers perceived visits 
      as less useful to pharmacists working at independent pharmacies than those at 
      primary or grocery pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: Over 80% of pharmacists reported 
      facing greater than one naloxone dispensing barrier. While cost/insurance issues 
      appear ubiquitous, patient stigma-related factors were prevalent in primary and 
      grocery pharmacies. Although many pharmacists are comfortable dispensing naloxone 
      under the standing order, pharmacists at independent pharmacies are less 
      comfortable, potentially secondary to lower standing order enrollment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: California has sought to expand medication access and improve public 
      health by authorizing pharmacists in California to prescribe certain medications 
      since 2014. Medications with pharmacist-initiated prescribing, or furnishing, 
      include naloxone, hormonal contraception, postexposure prophylaxis/preexposure 
      prophylaxis, and nicotine replacement therapy. In light of the United States' 
      opioid epidemic, naloxone, an opioid antagonist, this study considered furnishing 
      rates in urban areas of California. Research from 2020 found 42.5% of pharmacies 
      furnished naloxone. However, there has been limited study of furnishing outside 
      of urban areas. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed pharmacist furnishing rates of 
      naloxone in California's Central Valley and identified barriers and facilitators 
      to implementation. METHODS: From April to May 2022, the researchers first 
      conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of community and mail-order 
      pharmacies in California's largely rural Central Valley, then collected interview 
      data from a subset of pharmacists in stores that indicated they furnished 
      naloxone. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of Central Valley pharmacies reported that 
      they furnished naloxone. Interview respondents reported that barriers to 
      furnishing included time restrictions, cost to patients, stigma, and language 
      barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Furnishing rates in the Central Valley were slightly 
      higher (43.4%) than those reported in previous research focusing on urban areas 
      of California (42.5%). Identified barriers to furnishing were consistent with 
      those identified in previous research. These findings suggest that further policy 
      interventions may be needed to reduce out-of-pocket costs, establish stronger 
      pharmacist-provider relationships, and provide education combatting stigma 
      against opioid users to increase naloxone furnishing.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to nurse practitioner buprenorphine prescribing for 
      opioid use disorder in primary care settings.
PG  - 112-121
LID - 10.1097/JXX.0000000000000811 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment is critical 
      to curbing the opioid epidemic, particularly for rural residents who experience 
      numerous health and health care disparities, including higher overdose death 
      rates and limited OUD treatment access compared with urban dwellers. 
      Buprenorphine-naloxone is an evidence-based treatment for OUD that is well suited 
      for rural areas. However, providers must have a specialized federal waiver to 
      prescribe the medication. Despite the acceleration of the opioid epidemic in 
      rural areas and the recent liberalization of federal buprenorphine-naloxone 
      prescribing laws, few providers hold buprenorphine-naloxone prescribing waivers 
      and even fewer prescribe the medication. PURPOSE: This study explores barriers 
      and facilitators to buprenorphine-naloxone prescribing among nurse practitioners 
      (NPs) working in primary care settings in eastern North Carolina. METHODOLOGY: 
      Individual interviews were conducted with 13 NPs working in primary care settings 
      in eastern North Carolina. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to identify 
      perceived barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine-naloxone prescribing. 
      RESULTS: Analysis found prescribing barriers related to OUD stigma, perceived 
      knowledge, federal and state regulation, and prescribing resources and found 
      facilitators related to adopting a person-centered approach, developing 
      prescriber skills, and access to prescribing resources. CONCLUSIONS: The barriers 
      and facilitators that NPs experience related to buprenorphine prescribing for OUD 
      are similar to those faced by physicians, although the barriers arguably more 
      profound. Future research should consider how to mitigate these prescribing 
      barriers to facilitate NP buprenorphine prescribing for OUD. IMPLICATIONS: To our 
      knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of NP buprenorphine-naloxone 
      prescribing in rural areas. Given the prominence of OUD in rural regions and the 
      key role NPs play in primary care provision, this study lays import groundwork 
      for developing interventions to support buprenorphine-naloxone prescribing by NPs 
      practicing in rural regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacists' provision of naloxone services in community pharmacy 
      settings is well-recognized. Recently, studies describing pharmacists' naloxone 
      services in settings other than community pharmacies have emerged in the 
      literature. There is a need to synthesize evidence from these studies to evaluate 
      the scope and impact of pharmacists' naloxone services beyond community pharmacy 
      settings. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review were to a) 
      identify pharmacists' naloxone services and their outcomes, and b) examine 
      knowledge, attitudes, and barriers (KAB) related to naloxone service provision in 
      non-community pharmacy settings. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified using 
      PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 
      peer-reviewed empirical research conducted in the U.S. from January 2010 through 
      February 2022; published in English; and addressed a) pharmacists' naloxone 
      services and/or b) KAB related to the implementation of naloxone services. PRISMA 
      guidelines were used to report this study. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were 
      identified. The majority were non-randomized and observational; only two used a 
      randomized controlled (RCT) design. Most studies were conducted in veterans 
      affairs (30%) and academic medical centers (21%). Sample sizes ranged from n = 10 
      to 217,469, and the majority reported sample sizes <100. Pharmacists' naloxone 
      services involved clinical staff education, utilization of screening tools to 
      identify at-risk patients, naloxone prescribing and overdose education and 
      naloxone dispensing (OEND). Outcomes of implementing naloxone services included 
      improved naloxone knowledge, positive attitudes, increased OEND, and overdose 
      reversals. Pharmacists cited inadequate training, time constraints, reimbursement 
      issues, and stigma as barriers that hindered naloxone service implementation. 
      CONCLUSION: This systematic review found robust evidence regarding 
      pharmacist-based naloxone services beyond community pharmacy settings. Future 
      programs should use targeted approaches to help pharmacists overcome barriers and 
      enhance naloxone services. Additional research is needed to evaluate pharmacist 
      naloxone services by using rigorous methodologies (e.g., larger sample sizes, RCT 
      designs).

TI  - Predicting Patient Satisfaction With Medications for Treating Opioid Use 
      Disorder: Case Study Applying Natural Language Processing to Reviews of Methadone 
      and Buprenorphine/Naloxone on Health-Related Social Media.
PG  - e37207
LID - 10.2196/37207 [doi]
LID - e37207
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is an effective method for 
      treating opioid use disorder (OUD), which combines behavioral therapies with one 
      of three Food and Drug Administration-approved medications: methadone, 
      buprenorphine, and naloxone. While MAT has been shown to be effective initially, 
      there is a need for more information from the patient perspective about the 
      satisfaction with medications. Existing research focuses on patient satisfaction 
      with the entirety of the treatment, making it difficult to determine the unique 
      role of medication and overlooking the views of those who may lack access to 
      treatment due to being uninsured or concerns over stigma. Studies focusing on 
      patients' perspectives are also limited by the lack of scales that can 
      efficiently collect self-reports across domains of concerns. OBJECTIVE: A broad 
      survey of patients' viewpoints can be obtained through social media and drug 
      review forums, which are then assessed using automated methods to discover 
      factors associated with medication satisfaction. Because the text is 
      unstructured, it may contain a mix of formal and informal language. The primary 
      aim of this study was to use natural language processing methods on text posted 
      on health-related social media to detect patients' satisfaction with two 
      well-studied OUD medications: methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone. METHODS: We 
      collected 4353 patient reviews of methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone from 2008 
      to 2021 posted on WebMD and Drugs.com. To build our predictive models for 
      detecting patient satisfaction, we first employed different analyses to build 
      four input feature sets using the vectorized text, topic models, duration of 
      treatment, and biomedical concepts by applying MetaMap. We then developed six 
      prediction models: logistic regression, Elastic Net, least absolute shrinkage and 
      selection operator, random forest classifier, Ridge classifier, and extreme 
      gradient boosting to predict patients' satisfaction. Lastly, we compared the 
      prediction models' performance over different feature sets. RESULTS: Topics 
      discovered included oral sensation, side effects, insurance, and doctor visits. 
      Biomedical concepts included symptoms, drugs, and illnesses. The F-score of the 
      predictive models across all methods ranged from 89.9% to 90.8%. The Ridge 
      classifier model, a regression-based method, outperformed the other models. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of patients' satisfaction with opioid dependency 
      treatment medication can be predicted using automated text analysis. Adding 
      biomedical concepts such as symptoms, drug name, and illness, along with the 
      duration of treatment and topic models, had the most benefits for improving the 
      prediction performance of the Elastic Net model compared to other models. Some of 
      the factors associated with patient satisfaction overlap with domains covered in 
      medication satisfaction scales (eg, side effects) and qualitative patient reports 
      (eg, doctors' visits), while others (insurance) are overlooked, thereby 
      underscoring the value added from processing text on online health forums to 
      better understand patient adherence.

AB  - Background: The opioid crisis is a public health emergency in the United States, 
      particularly in rural Pennsylvania. Stigma in rural communities is a treatment 
      barrier and impacts harm reduction programming availability.Objectives: The 
      current study utilized an observational, cross-sectional design to examine latent 
      subgroups of stigma and differences in support for harm reduction strategies 
      (i.e., safe injection facilities, syringe services programs, fentanyl test 
      strips, Naloxone distribution). Participants included rural Pennsylvanians 
      (n = 252), taken from a statewide survey of opioid use disorder (OUD) stigma. 
      Participants reported OUD public stigma (i.e., attitudes/perceptions about OUD, 
      willingness to engage with individuals with OUD) and support for harm reduction 
      strategies.Results: Latent class analysis identified 4 stigma classes: 1) high 
      stigma (HS), 2) high judgment/low stigmatizing behavior (HJ/LB), 3) high 
      stigmatizing behavior/low stigmatizing attitude (HB/LA), and 4) low stigma (LS). 
      ANCOVAs identified subgroup differences in harm reduction support. The HS group 
      indicated less support for safe injection sites, syringe services programs, and 
      fentanyl test strips, compared to the HB/LA and LS groups. The HS group indicated 
      less support for Naloxone distribution compared to the HJ/LB, HB/LA, and LS 
      groups. Lastly, the HJ/LB group indicated less support for each program compared 
      to the LS group.Conclusions/Importance: Findings highlight that OUD stigma 
      profiles differ across rural Pennsylvania and are associated with varying support 
      for harm reduction strategies. Individuals with less stigma report more support 
      for harm reduction strategies. Interventions to implement harm reduction 
      strategies should consider varying levels of stigma and use a targeted approach 
      to inform implementation and messaging strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report on efforts to measure readiness to adopt opioid safety 
      initiatives in community pharmacies within 2 large chains. Previous studies 
      identified lack of knowledge, confidence, or enthusiasm in addressing harm 
      reduction efforts. We implemented an intervention that provided training to 
      improve opioid safety. The goal was to increase naloxone prescribing and 
      nonprescription syringe sales, reduce stigma, and decrease opioid overdoses among 
      patients and customers. OBJECTIVES: To assess pharmacy readiness for intervention 
      delivery, by characterizing pharmacy culture around opioid safety; describing 
      current practices and challenges interacting with patients and customers on 
      naloxone, nonprescription syringe sales, and buprenorphine; and determining 
      pharmacy defined goals for implementing the intervention. METHODS: The sample 
      included pharmacy managers and staff pharmacists from 2 large chains who 
      completed a brief phone interview. Interviews consisted of Likert-scale and 
      open-ended, theoretically driven questions. Questions focused on workplace 
      culture, patient engagement, naloxone and buprenorphine prescribing, 
      nonprescription syringe sales, and intervention goals. Coding categories for the 
      open-ended questions were derived using a thematic review of responses. RESULTS: 
      A total of 163 respondents described both workplace culture and how they 
      encourage patient opioid safety as including public health awareness, patient 
      engagement, and naloxone prescribing. Sale of nonprescription syringes exhibited 
      high variability: no sales barriers (53.9%), sales with barriers (21.5%), and no 
      sales (20.9%). Half of pharmacists (50.3%) interacted with buprenorphine 
      prescribers outside of medication fills. Most respondents (68.7%) endorsed being 
      ready to promote the intervention. Pharmacists named goals in adopting the 
      intervention of wanting more knowledge and educational materials, talking points 
      with patients, and best practices for offering naloxone. CONCLUSION: Community 
      pharmacists, before implementation, described awareness of and receptiveness to 
      opioid safety initiatives, with substantial barriers around nonprescription 
      syringe sales. Assessed knowledge level, culture, and identified barriers that 
      emerged in the readiness assessments can be used to tailor future 
      pharmacy-specific programming.

      What Cost?
PG  - 7-9

AB  - Because opioid overdose deaths in the United States continue to rise, it is 
      critical to increase patient access to buprenorphine, which treats opioid use 
      disorder and reduces mortality. An underrecognized barrier to buprenorphine 
      treatment (both for maintenance and treatment of acute withdrawal) is limited 
      access to buprenorphine monoproduct. In the United States, buprenorphine is 
      primarily prescribed as a combination product also containing naloxone, added to 
      reduce the potential for misuse. Because naloxone has relatively low sublingual 
      bioavailability compared with buprenorphine, adverse effects are generally 
      considered mild and rare. The authors' clinical experience, however, suggests 
      that adverse effects may be less benign than generally accepted and can have 
      negative effects for the patient, the provider-patient relationship, and the 
      health care system as a whole. The insistence on prescribing combination product 
      can foster stigma and mistrust, creating barriers to care and increased risk of 
      overdose and death.

TI  - U.S. Military veterans and the opioid overdose crisis: a review of risk factors 
      and prevention efforts.
PG  - 1826-1838
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2022.2092896 [doi]
AB  - U.S. military veterans have been heavily impacted by the opioid overdose crisis, 
      with drug overdose mortality rates increasing by 53% from 2010-2019. Risk for 
      overdose among veterans is complex and influenced by ongoing interaction among 
      physiological/biological, psychological, and socio-structural factors. A thorough 
      understanding of opioid-related overdose among veterans, one that goes beyond 
      simple pharmacological determinism, must examine the interplay of pain, pain 
      treatment, and stress, as well as psychological and social experiences-before, 
      during, and after military service. Comprehensive efforts to tackle the overdose 
      crisis among veterans require interventions that address each of these 
      dimensions. Promising interventions include widespread naloxone distribution and 
      increased provision of low-threshold wrap-around services, including medications 
      for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and holistic/complementary approaches. 
      Interventions that are delivered by peers - individuals who share key 
      experiential or sociodemographic characteristics with the population being served 
      - may be ideally suited to address many of the barriers to opioid-related risk 
      mitigation common among veterans. Community care models could be beneficial for 
      the large proportion of veterans who are not connected to the Veterans Health 
      Administration and for veterans who, for various reasons including mental health 
      problems and the avoidance of stigma, are socially isolated or reluctant to use 
      traditional substance use services. Interventions need to be tailored in such a 
      way that they reach those more socially isolated veterans who may not have access 
      to naloxone or the social support to help them in overdose situations. It is 
      important to incorporate the perspectives and voices of veterans with lived 
      experience of substance use into the design and implementation of new overdose 
      prevention resources and strategies to meet the needs of this population. Key 
      messagesU.S. military veterans have been heavily impacted by the opioid overdose 
      crisis, with drug overdose mortality rates increasing by 53% from 2010-2019.The 
      risks for overdose that veterans face need to be understood as resulting from an 
      ongoing interaction among biological/physiological, psychological, and 
      social/structural factors.Addressing drug overdose in the veteran population 
      requires accessible and non-judgemental, low threshold, wraparound, and holistic 
      solutions that recognise the complex aetiology of overdose risk for veterans.

TI  - The Influence of Stigmatizing Messages on Danger Appraisal: Examining the Model 
      of Stigma Communication for Opioid-Related Stigma, Policy Support, and Related 
      Outcomes.
PG  - 1765-1777

AB  - Drug overdose is a leading cause of injury and death in the United States, and 
      opioids are among the most significant of causes. For people with opioid use 
      disorders (OUDs), opioid stigma can lead to devastating consequences, including 
      anxiety and depression. Still, mass media may stigmatize people with OUDs by 
      ascribing stigmatizing labels (e.g., "opioid addict") and other stigma features 
      to those individuals. However, it is unclear how these stigmatizing messages 
      influence public perceptions of people with OUDs and public support for 
      rehabilitation and Naloxone administration policies. The model of stigma 
      communication (MSC) provides a framework for understanding these relationships. 
      This study used the MSC in two online factorial experiments, the first among 
      college undergraduates (N = 231) and the second among Amazon Mechanical Turk 
      workers (N = 245), to examine how stigmatizing messages about people with OUDs 
      influence stigma-related outcomes. Results reveal that opioid stigma messages 
      influence different outcomes depending on the content of those messages. 
      Classification messages with a stigmatizing mark (e.g., "Alex appears unkempt") 
      and label (e.g., "opioid addict") led to greater perceptions of dangerousness and 
      threat in both studies. High stigma classification messages also led to an 
      increased desire for behavioral regulation and social distance in Study 2. 
      Structural equation modeling in Study 1 also supported the applicability of the 
      MSC in the opioid context. Implications for health communication theory 
      development and practice are discussed.

TI  - Naloxone accessibility without an outside prescription from U.S. community 
      pharmacies: A systematic review.
PG  - 1725-1740
LID - S1544-3191(22)00240-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.japh.2022.07.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has identified limited naloxone accessibility in 
      community pharmacies. OBJECTIVES: To summarize current literature regarding 
      naloxone accessibility without an outside prescription from U.S. community 
      pharmacies and discuss implications on community pharmacists' ability to mitigate 
      the opioid overdose epidemic. METHODS: A systematic review was developed in 
      accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed was searched up to May 12, 2022. 
      References from articles chosen for inclusion were subsequently reviewed to 
      identify additional relevant studies. Peer-reviewed publications reporting new 
      data regarding the accessibility of naloxone from U.S. community pharmacies 
      without an outside prescription (e.g., standing order, protocol) were included. 
      Review articles and articles written in a non-English language were excluded. 
      Individual study data were reported, along with a qualitative discussion of 
      limitations of individual studies and in aggregate. When possible, naloxone 
      accessibility data were also pooled and reported as overall accessibility and 
      further stratified by chain versus independent pharmacies and urban versus rural 
      settings. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. Naloxone was in stock in 6867 of 
      10,934 (62.8%) pharmacies, though this varied greatly between studies (range, 
      26.4%-96.1%). Chain pharmacies were more likely to stock naloxone than 
      independents (69.7% [range, 35.4%-89.1%] vs. 36.4% [range, 19.1%-89.7%], P < 
      0.0001). Stocking did not significantly differ between urban and rural locations. 
      A total of 5660 of 8999 (62.9%; range, 23.5%-97%) pharmacies audited were willing 
      to dispense without a prescription, with chain (67.4% vs. 22.2%, P < 0.0001) and 
      rural (69.3% vs. 40.7%, P < 0.0001) pharmacies more likely than independent and 
      urban, respectively. Key access barriers identified included naloxone not 
      stocked, high naloxone cost, and pharmacist misinformation or stigma. CONCLUSION: 
      Though limited by study heterogeneity, analysis of thirty U.S. studies revealed 
      naloxone was available without a prescription in less than two-thirds of 
      community pharmacies. Availability varied significantly by study and pharmacy 
      type.

TI  - Improving Community Pharmacist-Delivered Care for Patients With Psychiatric 
      Disorders Filling an Opioid Prescription.
PG  - 1294-1297
LID - 10.1176/appi.ps.202100592 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacists tend to provide care to patients with psychiatric disorders less 
      frequently than to other types of patients, yet patients with psychiatric 
      disorders experience more drug-related problems and use more opioids than those 
      without psychiatric disorders. The Opioid and Naloxone Education (ONE) program 
      equipped pharmacists to screen for opioid misuse and overdose risk and to 
      implement a set of interventions for any patient filling an opioid prescription. 
      Patients with a psychiatric disorder (N=1,980; 24.1% of those screened) were 
      significantly more likely to receive more than one intervention from a ONE 
      program pharmacist than were those without a psychiatric disorder. The use of an 
      objective screening tool and training in stigma reduction and nonjudgmental 
      communication approaches, which are part of the ONE program process, deserve 
      further exploration as ways to increase the frequency of pharmacist-provided 
      education and other critical interventions for patients with psychiatric 
      disorders.

AB  - There are more than 200 opioid overdose deaths each day in the US. In combating 
      this epidemic we look to available treatment tools. Here, we find only three 
      medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment 
      of opioid use disorder. Of the three, buprenorphine is of particular importance 
      due to its reduced overdose potential as a partial opioid agonist. Evidence 
      supports its clinical equivalence to its full agonist cousin methadone, and 
      suggests that it is better slated for long-term treatment of opioid use disorder 
      compared to the non-selective opioid antagonist naltrexone. Buprenorphine is most 
      popularized within Suboxone, a medication which also contains the non-selective 
      opioid antagonist naloxone. The naloxone has no additional effect when the drug 
      is taken as instructed, as it is intended to prevent diversion in those that 
      would attempt to inject the medication. While Suboxone is regarded by some as the 
      future of medical treatment, others have expressed concerns. This review aims to 
      explore the history, controversy, and open questions that surround buprenorphine 
      and its most prescribed variation, Suboxone. These include its pharmacological, 
      legislative, and social history, alternative indications, efficacy as a treatment 
      of opioid use disorder, and more. Armed with this information, the reader will 
      have a more in-depth and holistic understanding of the medication's place in 
      their community.

TI  - A systematic review of the distribution of take-home naloxone in low- and 
      middle-income countries and barriers to the implementation of take-home naloxone 
      programs.
PG  - 117

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose epidemic is hitting record highs worldwide, 
      accounting for 76% of mortality related to substance use. Take-home naloxone 
      (THN) strategies are being implemented in many developed countries that suffer 
      from high opioid overdose death rates. They aim to provide overdose 
      identification and naloxone administration training, along with THN delivery to 
      opioid users and others likely to witness an overdose incident such as family 
      members and peers. However, little is known about such measures in low- and 
      middle-income countries (LMIC), where opioid use and opioid-related deaths are 
      reportedly high. This systematic literature review aims to examine the 
      distribution of THN in LMIC, review studies identifying barriers to the 
      implementation of THN programs worldwide, and assess their applicability to LMIC. 
      METHODS: The literature was searched and analyzed for eligible studies with 
      quality assessment. RESULTS: Two studies were found from LMIC on THN programs 
      with promising results, and 13 studies were found on the barriers identified in 
      implementing THN programs worldwide. The main barriers to THN strategies were the 
      lack of training of healthcare providers, lack of privileges, time constraints, 
      cost, legislative/policy restrictions, stigma, fear of litigation, and some 
      misperceptions around THN. CONCLUSIONS: The barriers outlined in this paper are 
      probably applicable to LMIC, but more difficult to overcome considering the 
      differences in their response to opioid overdose, their cultural attitudes and 
      norms, the high cost, the waivers required, the legislative differences and the 
      severe penalties for drug-related offenses in some of these countries. The 
      solutions suggested to counter-act these obstacles can also be more difficult to 
      achieve in LMIC. Further research is required in this area with larger sample 
      sizes to provide a better understanding of the obstacles to the implementation, 
      feasibility, accessibility, and utilization of THN programs in LMIC.

TI  - Design details for overdose education and take-home naloxone kits: Codesign with 
      family medicine, emergency department, addictions medicine and community.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programmes 
      equip and train people who are likely to witness an opioid overdose to respond 
      with effective first aid interventions. Despite OEND expansion across North 
      America, overdose rates are increasing, raising questions about how to improve 
      OEND programmes. We conducted an iterative series of codesign stakeholder 
      workshops to develop a prototype for take-home naloxone (THN)-kit (i.e., two 
      doses of intranasal naloxone and training on how to administer it). METHODS: We 
      recruited people who use opioids, frontline healthcare providers and public 
      health representatives to participate in codesign workshops covering questions 
      related to THN-kit prototypes, training on how to use it, and implementation, 
      including refinement of design artefacts using personas and journey maps. 
      Completed over 9 months, the workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed with 
      visible results of the workshops (i.e., sticky notes, sketches) archived. We used 
      thematic analyses of these materials to identify design requirements for THN-kits 
      and training. RESULTS: We facilitated 13 codesign workshops to identify and 
      address gaps in existing opioid overdose education training and THN-kits and 
      emphasize timely response and stigma in future THN-kit design. Using an iterative 
      process, we created 15 prototypes, 3 candidate prototypes and a final prototype 
      THN-kit from the synthesis of the codesign workshops. CONCLUSION: The final 
      prototype is available for a variety of implementation and evaluation processes. 
      The THN-kit offers an integrated solution combining ultra-brief training 
      animation and physical packaging of nasal naloxone to be distributed in family 
      practice clinics, emergency departments, addiction medicine clinics and community 
      settings. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The codesign process was deliberately 
      structured to involve community members (the public), with multiple opportunities 
      for public contribution. In addition, patient/public participation was a 
      principle for the management and structuring of the research team.

AB  - Professions compete over jurisdictions by laying claim to specific tasks. 
      Research shows that they enhance their professional status by siphoning off tasks 
      and seizing control of social problems that belong to other professions. Not all 
      tasks are equally desirable, though. Studies find that workers resist helping 
      stigmatized groups or taking on "unsolvable" social problems. This raises a 
      critical question for social scientists: How do professionals respond when 
      opportunities for jurisdictional expansion are contingent on aiding a stigmatized 
      population? Our study draws on research from the sociology of culture, 
      professions, and stigma and empirical evidence about naloxone provision to 
      develop a theory of professional ambivalence that explains how professionals 
      respond to this fundamental tension. In response to rising rates of overdose 
      deaths in the U.S., many cities have adopted naloxone provision programs in which 
      first responders-police, firefighters, and EMTs-carry and administer naloxone, an 
      opioid overdose antidote. For police and firefighters, this task enables them to 
      venture into medical territory, but for all three professionals, it requires 
      working with the stigmatized population of people who use drugs. We use abductive 
      analysis of qualitative interviews (n = 20) conducted in a Midwestern 
      metropolitan area from 2018 to 2019 to explore professionals' attitudes about 
      naloxone. We find that professionals' willingness to take on new tasks is largely 
      grounded in how they construct patients as deserving or undeserving of care. 
      Deservingness construction is a constitutive process through which first 
      responders draw on cultural imaginaries about addiction and treatment as well as 
      their own experiences providing naloxone. This results in three mechanisms of 
      deservingness construction-experiential, behavioral, and interactional-that 
      reinforce cultural imaginaries and affect how they think about patients, 
      naloxone, and addiction. Findings contribute to theory of professional 
      ambivalence and offer policy implications to enhance the effectiveness of 
      naloxone provision programs.

TI  - Pharmacy naloxone codispensing: A mixed methods study of practices and 
      perspectives under a statewide standing order program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In a previous statewide naloxone purchase trial conducted in 
      Massachusetts, we documented high levels of naloxone accessibility, upon patient 
      request, under the state's naloxone standing order (NSO) program. Equally 
      important for reducing overdose mortality rates is expanding naloxone access via 
      codispensing alongside opioid prescription and syringe purchases at pharmacies. 
      OBJECTIVE: To understand naloxone codispensing from the perspective of 
      pharmacists under the Massachusetts NSO program. METHODS: The study used a mixed 
      methods design involving 3 focus groups and a quantitative survey. Participants 
      in both the focus groups (N = 27) and survey (N = 339) were licensed 
      Massachusetts pharmacists. Focus groups were conducted at 3 separate professional 
      conferences for pharmacists. The survey was conducted using a stratified random 
      sample of 400 chain and independent retail pharmacies across Massachusetts. All 
      data were collected between September 2018 and November 2019. Quantitative and 
      qualitative analyses examined current policies, practices, and attitudes 
      regarding naloxone codispensing for patients at risk of opioid overdose. RESULTS: 
      Most pharmacists (69%) reported that they, their pharmacy, or both promoted 
      codispensing alongside opioid prescriptions. A majority promoting naloxone 
      codispensing did so for patients prescribed high opioid dosages (80%); fewer 
      promoted codispensing for patients also prescribed benzodiazepines (20%). 
      Facilitators to codispensing were pre-existing relationships between pharmacists 
      and prescribers, mandatory pharmacist consultation, and universal naloxone 
      promotion to all patients meeting certain criteria. Barriers to codispensing were 
      pharmacists' concerns about offending patients by initiating a conversation about 
      naloxone, insufficient technician training, workflow and resource constraints, 
      and misconceptions surrounding naloxone. We found no substantive differences in 
      outcomes between chain and independent pharmacies. CONCLUSION: We documented 
      several facilitators and barriers to naloxone codispensing in Massachusetts 
      pharmacies. Areas amenable to intervention include increased training for 
      front-line pharmacy technicians, mandatory pharmacist consultation for 
      opioid-prescribed patients, workflow reorganization, and addressing stigma 
      concerns on the pharmacist end.

TI  - Responding to a surge in overdose deaths: perspectives from US syringe services 
      programs.
PG  - 79
LID - 10.1186/s12954-022-00664-y [doi]
LID - 79
AB  - BACKGROUND: US overdose deaths have reached a record high. Syringe services 
      programs (SSPs) play a critical role in addressing this crisis by providing 
      multiple services to people who use drugs (PWUD) that help prevent overdose 
      death. This study examined the perspectives of leadership and staff from a 
      geographically diverse sample of US SSPs on factors contributing to the overdose 
      surge, their organization's response, and ongoing barriers to preventing overdose 
      death. METHODS: From 2/11/2021 to 4/23/2021, we conducted semi-structured 
      interviews with leadership and staff from 27 SSPs sampled from the North American 
      Syringe Exchange Network directory. Interviews were transcribed and qualitatively 
      analyzed using a Rapid Assessment Process. RESULTS: Respondents reported that 
      increased intentional and unintentional fentanyl use (both alone and combined 
      with other substances) was a major driver of the overdose surge. They also 
      described how the COVID-19 pandemic increased solitary drug use and led to abrupt 
      increases in use due to life disruptions and worsened mental health among PWUD. 
      In response to this surge, SSPs have increased naloxone distribution, including 
      providing more doses per person and expanding distribution to people using 
      non-opioid drugs. They are also adapting overdose prevention education to 
      increase awareness of fentanyl risks, including for people using non-opioid 
      drugs. Some are distributing fentanyl test strips, though a few respondents 
      expressed doubts about strips' effectiveness in reducing overdose harms. Some 
      SSPs are expanding education and naloxone training/distribution in the broader 
      community, beyond PWUD and their friends/family. Respondents described several 
      ongoing barriers to preventing overdose death, including not reaching certain 
      groups at risk of overdose (PWUD who do not inject, PWUD experiencing 
      homelessness, and PWUD of color), an inconsistent naloxone supply and lack of 
      access to intranasal naloxone in particular, inadequate funding, underestimates 
      of overdoses, legal/policy barriers, and community stigma. CONCLUSIONS: SSPs 
      remain essential in preventing overdose deaths amid record numbers likely driven 
      by increased fentanyl use and COVID-19-related impacts. These findings can inform 
      efforts to support SSPs in this work. In the face of ongoing barriers, support 
      for SSPs-including increased resources, political support, and community 
      partnership-is urgently needed to address the worsening overdose crisis.

TI  - A qualitative examination of naloxone access in three states: Connecticut, 
      Kentucky, and Wisconsin.
PG  - 1387

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of opioid-involved overdose deaths remains a public health 
      priority in the United States. While expanding access to naloxone is a national 
      public health strategy, it is largely implemented at the state and local level, 
      where significant variability in policies, resources, and norms exist. The aims 
      of the current study were to examine the social context of naloxone access in 
      three different states (Connecticut, Kentucky, Wisconsin) from the perspectives 
      of key informants (first responders, harm reduction personnel, and pharmacists), 
      who play some role in dispensing or administering naloxone within their 
      communities. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with key informants who were in 
      different local areas (urban, suburban, rural) across Connecticut, Kentucky, and 
      Wisconsin. Interview guides explored the key informants' experiences with 
      administering or dispensing naloxone, and their perspectives on opioid overdose 
      prevention efforts in their areas. Data analysis was conducted using multistage 
      inductive coding and comparative methods to identify dominant themes within the 
      data. RESULTS: Key informants in each of the three states noted progress toward 
      expanding naloxone access, especially among people who use opioids, but also 
      described inequities. The key role of harm reduction programs in distributing 
      naloxone within their communities was also highlighted by participants, as well 
      as barriers to increasing naloxone access through pharmacies. Although there was 
      general consensus regarding the effectiveness of expanding naloxone access to 
      prevent overdose deaths, the results indicate that communities are still 
      grappling with stigma associated with drug use and a harm reduction approach. 
      CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that public health interventions that target 
      naloxone distribution through harm reduction programs can enhance access within 
      local communities. Strategies that address stigmatizing attitudes toward people 
      who use drugs and harm reduction may also facilitate naloxone expansion efforts, 
      overall, as well as policies that improve the affordability and awareness of 
      naloxone through the pharmacy.

TI  - "It wasn't here, and now it is. It's everywhere": fentanyl's rising presence in 
      Oregon's drug supply.
PG  - 76

AB  - BACKGROUND: Illicit fentanyl has contributed to a drastic increase in overdose 
      drug deaths. While fentanyl has subsumed the drug supply in the Northeastern and 
      Midwestern USA, it has more recently reached the Western USA. For this study, we 
      explored perspectives of people who use drugs (PWUD) on the changing drug supply 
      in Oregon, experiences of and response to fentanyl-involved overdose, and 
      recommendations from PWUD to reduce overdose risk within the context of illicit 
      fentanyl's dramatic increase in the recreational drug supply over the past 
      decade. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews by phone with 34 PWUD in Oregon 
      from May to June of 2021. We used thematic analysis to analyze transcripts and 
      construct themes. RESULTS: PWUD knew about fentanyl, expressed concern about 
      fentanyl pills, and were aware of other illicit drugs containing fentanyl. 
      Participants were aware of the increased risk of an overdose but remained 
      reluctant to engage with professional first responders due to fear of arrest. 
      Participants had recommendations for reducing fentanyl overdose risk, including 
      increasing access to information, harm reduction supplies (e.g., naloxone, 
      fentanyl test strips), and medications for opioid use disorder; establishing drug 
      checking services and overdose prevention sites; legalizing and regulating the 
      drug supply; and reducing stigma enacted by healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: 
      PWUD in Oregon are aware of the rise of fentanyl and fentanyl pills and desire 
      access to tools to reduce harm from fentanyl. As states in the Western USA face 
      an inflection point of fentanyl in the drug supply, public health staff, 
      behavioral health providers, and first responders can take action identified by 
      the needs of PWUD.

TI  - Priority setting for Canadian Take-Home Naloxone best practice guideline 
      development: an adapted online Delphi method.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/s12954-022-00650-4 [doi]
LID - 71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Take-Home Naloxone (THN) is a core intervention aimed at addressing 
      the toxic illicit opioid drug supply crisis. Although THN programs are available 
      in all provinces and territories throughout Canada, there are currently no 
      standardized guidelines for THN programs. The Delphi method is a tool for 
      consensus building often used in policy development that allows for engagement of 
      stakeholders. METHODS: We used an adapted anonymous online Delphi method to 
      elicit priorities for a Canadian guideline on THN as a means of facilitating 
      meaningful stakeholder engagement. A guideline development group generated a 
      series of key questions that were then brought to a 15-member voting panel. The 
      voting panel was comprised of people with lived and living experience of 
      substance use, academics specializing in harm reduction, and clinicians and 
      public health professionals from across Canada. Two rounds of voting were 
      undertaken to score questions on importance for inclusion in the guideline. 
      RESULTS: Nine questions that were identified as most important include what 
      equipment should be in THN kits, whether there are important differences between 
      intramuscular and intranasal naloxone administration, how stigma impacts access 
      to distribution programs, how effective THN programs are at saving lives, what 
      distribution models are most effective and equitable, storage considerations for 
      naloxone in a community setting, the role of CPR and rescue breathing in overdose 
      response, client preference of naloxone distribution program type, and what 
      aftercare should be provided for people who respond to overdoses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The Delphi method is an equitable consensus building process that generated 
      priorities to guide guideline development.

TI  - A longitudinal study of naloxone opioid overdose awareness and reversal training 
      for first-year medical students: specific elements require reinforcement.
PG  - 70

AB  - BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic is a progressively worsening public health crisis 
      that continues to impact healthcare system strategies such as overdose reversal 
      and destigmatization. Even among healthcare professionals, there remains a lack 
      of confidence in naloxone administration and a prevalence of stigma. While 
      training can play a major impact in reducing these shortcomings, the long-term 
      effectiveness has yet to be characterized in training healthcare professionals. 
      This study examined the long-term retention of opioid overdose awareness and 
      reversal training (OOART) by evaluating performance at two-time intervals, 
      immediately post-training and at a 3-month follow-up. METHODS: Voluntary training 
      was offered to first-year (M1) medical students at the Drexel University College 
      of Medicine in 2021. At this training, 118 students completed training, 95 
      completed the post-training survey, and 42 completed the 3-month follow-up. 
      RESULTS: Opioid reversal knowledge questions assessed significantly increased 
      scores post-training and at the 3-month follow-up. In three of the attitude 
      questions, scores were improved at both follow-up timepoints. In addition, three 
      attitude questions indicating a participant's confidence to respond to an opioid 
      overdose situation increased directly after the training, but regressed at the 
      3-month follow-up. The remaining questions did not show any statistical 
      difference across the survey intervals. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes that 
      while OOART provides participants with the knowledge of how to respond to an 
      opioid overdose, the retention of this knowledge at a 3-month interval is 
      reduced. The results were mixed for longitudinal assessment of participant's 
      attitudes toward people with opioid use disorder. Some positive increases in 
      attitudes were retained at the 3-month interval, while others trended back toward 
      pre-training levels. These results support the effectiveness of the training but 
      also provide evidence that OOART must be reinforced often.

AB  - Despite growing awareness of opioid use disorder (OUD), fatal overdoses and 
      downstream health conditions (e.g., hepatitis C and HIV) continue to rise in some 
      populations. Various interrelated structural forces, together with social and 
      economic determinants, contribute to this ongoing crisis; among these, access to 
      medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and stigma towards people with OUD 
      remain understudied. We combined data on methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone 
      providers from SAMHSA's 2019 directory, additional naltrexone providers from 
      Vivitrol's location finder service, with a nationally representative survey 
      called "The AmeriSpeak survey on stigma toward people with OUD." Integrating the 
      social-ecological framework, we focus on individual characteristics, personal and 
      family members' experience with OUD, and spatial access to MOUD at the community 
      level. We use nationally representative survey data from 3008 respondents who 
      completed their survey in 2020. Recognizing that stigma is a multifaceted 
      construct, we also examine how the process varies for different types of stigma, 
      specifically perceived dangerousness and untrustworthiness, as well as social 
      distancing measures under different scenarios. We found a significant association 
      between stigma and spatial access to MOUD - more resources are related to weaker 
      stigma. Respondents had a stronger stigma towards people experiencing current OUD 
      (versus past OUD), and they were more concerned about OUD if the person would 
      marry into their family (versus being their coworkers). Additionally, 
      respondents' age, sex, education, and personal experience with OUD were also 
      associated with their stigma, and the association can vary depending on the 
      specific type of stigma. Overall, stigma towards people with OUD was associated 
      with both personal experiences and environmental measures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: People experiencing homelessness (PEH) make up a disproportionate 
      share of opioid overdose fatalities. We set out to identify the facilitators and 
      barriers that shape whether PEH initiate medications for opioid use disorder 
      (MOUDs), both generally and after an overdose. METHODS: We conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with 29 PEH in Boston who had self-reported history of 
      opioid overdose. Seventeen participants had taken prescribed MOUD, and 12 had 
      not. Using NVivo software we then coded transcripts applying the Borkan Immersion 
      Crystallization method to identify individual, social, and structural factors 
      influencing MOUD initiation. RESULTS: Individual factors: Within the "timing" 
      theme, non-fatal overdoses often led participants to feel sick with 
      naloxone-induced withdrawal, decreasing treatment-seeking. By contrast, chronic 
      opioid use consequences, like daily stress with finding drugs and shelter, 
      increased interest in MOUD. Within the "medication benefits" and "medication 
      concerns" themes, interest in MOUD initiation hinged on whether participants 
      believed in or doubted MOUDs' effectiveness for reducing drug use. In a related 
      theme, participants perceived that individuals must be "ready" in order for MOUDs 
      to be effective. Social factors: Within the "peer influence" theme, peers who use 
      opioids were prominent sources of encouragement or deterrence for starting MOUD. 
      "Family influence" emerged as a theme for participants with MOUD history. 
      Structural factors: Within the "health systems" theme, participants described 
      that experiencing stigma from care providers toward people who use drugs was a 
      barrier to MOUD. Within the "treatment systems" theme, regulations made methadone 
      particularly difficult to access, even though nearly all participants had 
      Medicaid coverage to pay for treatment. Within the "criminal justice systems" 
      theme, participants reported frequent criminal justice involvement, with jails 
      facilitating or preventing MOUD access. CONCLUSIONS: Future interventions should 
      (a) increase MOUD interest by messaging-ideally via peers-that MOUDs are 
      effective for PEH and (b) increase MOUD access by making MOUDs available across 
      health, treatment, and carceral systems. Mobile outreach and MOUD treatment would 
      help reach PEH when they are facing daily opioid use disorder stressors and are 
      more open to MOUD initiation. Future research should explore how racial, ethnic, 
      and linguistic identities affect MOUD engagement among PEH.

AB  - Objective: Access to naloxone is a priority for reducing opioid overdose deaths. 
      Although participants who receive naloxone training are able to successfully 
      administer it, the impact of training on community member knowledge and attitudes 
      has not been explored. Participants: A total of 105 participants 18 years and 
      older at a medium-sized university completed assessments between August and 
      December 2019. Methods: Participants were scheduled to complete a standardized 
      30-minute naloxone training as developed by the research team. Assessments were 
      taken at baseline, immediately following, and three-months following education 
      using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes 
      Scale (OOAS). Results: The primary endpoint of change from baseline to immediate 
      post-education for total OOKS and OOAS median scores significantly improved 
      (p < 0.001) by 31 and 34 points, respectively. Conclusions: Naloxone education 
      provides an opportunity to improve community attitudes and reduce stigma over 
      time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expanding availability to naloxone is a core harm reduction strategy 
      in efforts to address the opioid epidemic. In the US, state-level legislation is 
      a prominent mechanism to expand naloxone availability through various venues, 
      such as community pharmacies. This qualitative study aimed to identify and 
      summarize the views of experts on state-level naloxone access laws. METHODS: We 
      conducted a three-round modified-Delphi process using the online ExpertLens 
      platform. Participants included 46 key stakeholders representing various groups 
      (advocates, healthcare providers, human/social service practitioners, 
      policymakers, and researchers) with expertise naloxone access laws. Participants 
      commented on the effectiveness and implementability of 15 state-level naloxone 
      access laws (NALs). We thematically analyzed participant comments to summarize 
      views on NALs overall and specific types of NAL. RESULTS: Participants commented 
      that the effectiveness of NALs in reducing opioid-related mortality depends on 
      their ability to make sustained, significant impacts on population-level naloxone 
      availability. Participants generally believed that increased naloxone 
      availability does not have appreciable negative impacts on the prevalence of 
      opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), and non-fatal opioid overdoses. 
      Implementation barriers include stigma among the general public, affordability of 
      naloxone, and reliance on an inequitable healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: Experts 
      believe NALs that significantly increase naloxone access are associated with less 
      overdose mortality without risking substantial unintended public health outcomes. 
      To maximize impacts, high-value NALs should explicitly counter existing 
      healthcare system inequities, address stigmatization of opioid use and naloxone, 
      maintain reasonable prices for purchasing naloxone, and target settings beyond 
      community pharmacies to distribute naloxone.

TI  - Safety Assessment and Pain Relief Properties of Saffron from Taliouine Region 
      (Morocco).

AB  - Saffron is the most expensive spice in the world. In addition to its culinary 
      utilization, this spice is used for medicinal purposes such as in pain 
      management. In this study, the analgesic activity of Crocus sativus stigma 
      extract (CSSE) was evaluated in rodents and its possible physiological mechanism 
      was elucidated. The anti-nociceptive effect of CSSE was evaluated using three 
      animal models (hot plate, writhing, and formalin tests). The analgesic pathways 
      involved were assessed using various analgesia-mediating receptors antagonists. 
      The oral administration of CSSE, up to 2000 mg/kg, caused no death or changes in 
      the behavior or in the hematological and biochemical blood parameters of treated 
      animals nor in the histological architecture of the animals' livers and kidneys. 
      CSSE showed a central, dose-dependent, anti-nociceptive effect in response to 
      thermal stimuli; and a peripheral analgesic effect in the test of contortions 
      induced by acetic acid. The dual (central and peripheral) analgesic effect was 
      confirmed by the formalin test. The anti-nociceptive activity of CSSE was totally 
      or partially reversed by the co-administration of receptor antagonists, naloxone, 
      atropine, haloperidol, yohimbine, and glibenclamide. CSSE influenced signal 
      processing, by the modulation of the opioidergic, adrenergic, and muscarinic 
      systems at the peripheral and central levels; and by regulation of the 
      dopaminergic system and control of the opening of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channels 
      at the spinal level. The obtained data point to a multimodal mechanism of action 
      for CSSE: An anti-inflammatory effect and a modulation, through different 
      physiological pathways, of the electrical signal generated by the nociceptors. 
      Further clinical trials are required to endorse the potential utilization of 
      Moroccan saffron as a natural painkiller.

TI  - Toward Safer Opioid Prescribing in HIV care (TOWER): a mixed-methods, 
      cluster-randomized trial.
PG  - 28

LID - 28
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2016 U.S. Centers for Disease Control Opioid Prescribing 
      Guideline (CDC Guideline) is currently being revised amid concern that it may be 
      harmful to people with chronic pain on long-term opioid therapy (CP-LTOT). 
      However, a methodology to faithfully implement the CDC guideline, measure 
      prescriber adherence, and systematically test its effect on patient and public 
      health outcomes is lacking. We developed and tested a CDC Guideline 
      implementation strategy (termed TOWER), focusing on an outpatient HIV-focused 
      primary care setting. METHODS: TOWER was developed in a stakeholder-engaged, 
      multi-step iterative process within an Information, Motivation and Behavioral 
      Skills (IMB) framework of behavior change. TOWER consists of: 1) a patient-facing 
      opioid management app (OM-App); 2) a progress note template (OM-Note) to guide 
      the office visit; and 3) a primary care provider (PCP) training. TOWER was 
      evaluated in a 9-month, randomized-controlled trial of HIV-PCPs (N = 11) and 
      their patients with HIV and CP-LTOT (N = 40). The primary outcome was CDC 
      Guideline adherence based on electronic health record (EHR) documentation and 
      measured by the validated Safer Opioid Prescribing Evaluation Tool (SOPET). 
      Qualitative data including one-on-one PCP interviews were collected. We also 
      piloted patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) reflective of domains 
      identified as important by stakeholders (pain intensity and function; mood; 
      substance use; medication use and adherence; relationship with provider; stigma 
      and discrimination). RESULTS: PCPs randomized to TOWER were 48% more CDC 
      Guideline adherent (p < 0.0001) with significant improvements in use of: 
      non-pharmacologic treatments, functional treatment goals, opioid agreements, 
      prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), opioid benefit/harm assessment, 
      and naloxone prescribing. Qualitative data demonstrated high levels of confidence 
      in conducting these care processes among intervention providers, and that OM-Note 
      supported these efforts while experience with OM-App was mixed. There were no 
      intervention-associated safety concerns (defined as worsening of any of the 
      PROMs). CONCLUSIONS: CDC-guideline adherence can be promoted and measured, and is 
      not associated with worsening of outcomes for people with HIV receiving LTOT for 
      CP. Future work would be needed to document scalability of these results and to 
      determine whether CDC-guideline adherence results in a positive effect on public 
      health. Trial registration https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03669939 .

TI  - Improving pharmacy students' empathy and attitudes regarding opioid overdose and 
      substance use disorder in a skills-based learning environment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Using a skills-based learning environment as a launch pad for 
      developing empathy for patients with substance use disorder or at high risk for 
      opioid overdose allows for learning continuity and early intervention. Empathy 
      for this patient population may reduce bias and stigma associated with negative 
      health outcomes. Previous studies have assessed empathy in pharmacy students, but 
      not in the context of substance use disorder and opioid overdose harm reduction 
      among first professional year pharmacy students in skills-based education. This 
      cohort study aimed to measure the change in empathy and opioid overdose-related 
      attitudes before and after a two-part skills-based learning activity that focused 
      on drug diversion and opioid overdose treatment. METHODS: First professional year 
      pharmacy students were given a pre- and post-survey consisting of empathy and 
      attitudes sections. The Kiersma-Chen Empathy Scale (KCES) and the Opioid Overdose 
      Attitudes Scale (OOAS) were used. The intervention was a skills-based learning 
      activity with two segments, one that focused on naloxone counseling and the other 
      focused on drug diversion. RESULTS: The aggregate mean change in KCES and OOAS 
      scores of the cohort increased by 1.837 (P = .014) and 2.349 (P = .008), 
      respectively. Of note, students with lower baseline empathy and attitudes scores 
      showed more improvement in both KCES and OOAS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Students 
      showed improvement in empathy and attitudes regarding opioid overdose and 
      substance use disorder. A larger magnitude of improvement was noted with lower 
      baseline scores.

AB  - Political affiliation, racial attitudes, and opioid stigma influence public 
      support for public health responses to address opioid use disorders (OUD). Prior 
      studies suggest public perceptions of the opioid epidemic are less racialized and 
      less politically polarized than were public perceptions of the crack cocaine 
      epidemic. Analyzing a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample 
      (n = 1161 U.S. adults) from the October 2020 AmeriSpeak survey, we explored how 
      political affiliation, racial attitudes (as captured in the Color-Blind Racial 
      Attitudes Scale [CoBRAS]), and OUD stigma were associated with respondents' 
      expressed views regarding four critical domains. Respondents with unfavorable 
      attitudes towards Black Americans were less likely to support expanding Medicaid 
      funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living 
      with OUD, and distributing naloxone for overdose prevention. Democratic Party 
      affiliation was associated with greater support for all three of the above 
      measures, and increased support for mandatory treatment, which may be seen as a 
      substitute for more punitive interventions. Black respondents were also less 
      likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to 
      provide services for people living with OUD, and of distributing naloxone. Our 
      finding suggest that negative attitudes towards African-Americans and political 
      differences remain important factors of public opinion on responding to the OUD 
      epidemic, even after controlling for opioid stigma. Our findings also suggest 
      that culturally-competent dialogue within politically conservative and Black 
      communities may be important to engage public support for evidence-informed 
      treatment and prevention.

TI  - If we build it, will they come? Perspectives on pharmacy-based naloxone among 
      family and friends of people who use opioids: a mixed methods study.
PG  - 735
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13078-z [doi]
LID - 735
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expanding access to the opioid antagonist naloxone to reduce overdose 
      mortality is a public health priority in the United States. Naloxone standing 
      orders (NSOs) have been established in many states to increase naloxone 
      dispensing at pharmacies, but increased pharmacy access does not ensure optimal 
      uptake among those likely to witness an overdose. In a prior statewide purchase 
      trial, we documented high levels of naloxone access at Massachusetts pharmacies 
      under a statewide NSO. In this study, we characterize barriers to pharmacy-based 
      naloxone uptake among potential opioid overdose "bystanders" (friends or family 
      of people who use opioids) that may be amenable to intervention. METHODS: 
      Eligible bystanders were Massachusetts residents ≥ 18 years of age, did not use 
      illicit opioids in the past 30 days, and knew someone who currently uses illicit 
      opioids. We used a sequential mixed methods approach, in which a series of 
      semi-structured qualitative interviews (N = 22) were conducted April-July 2018, 
      to inform the development of a subsequent quantitative survey (N = 260), 
      conducted February-July 2020. RESULTS: Most survey participants (77%) reported 
      ever obtaining naloxone but few (21%) attempted to purchase it at a pharmacy. 
      Qualitative participants revealed that barriers to utilizing the NSO included low 
      perceived risk of overdose, which was rooted in misconceptions regarding the 
      risks of prescription opioid misuse, denial about their loved one's drug use, and 
      drug use stereotypes; inaccurate beliefs about the impact of naloxone on riskier 
      opioid use; and concerns regarding anticipated stigma and confidentiality. Many 
      participants had engaged in mutual support groups, which served as a source of 
      free naloxone for half (50%) of those who had ever obtained naloxone. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite high levels of pharmacy naloxone access in Massachusetts, 
      few bystanders in our study had attempted to obtain naloxone under the NSO. Low 
      perceived risk of overdose, misinformation, stigma, and confidentiality were 
      important barriers to pharmacy naloxone uptake, all of which are amenable to 
      intervention. Support groups provided a setting for addressing stigma and 
      misinformation and provided a discreet and comfortable setting for naloxone 
      access. Where these groups do not exist and for bystanders who do not participate 
      in such groups, pharmacies are well-positioned to fill gaps in naloxone 
      availability.

TI  - Provider perspectives on emergency department initiation of medication assisted 
      treatment for alcohol use disorder.
PG  - 456
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-07862-1 [doi]
LID - 456
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is ubiquitous and its sequelae contribute 
      to high levels of healthcare utilization, yet AUD remains undertreated. The ED 
      encounter represents a missed opportunity to initiate medication assisted 
      treatment (MAT) for patients with AUD. The aims of this study are to identify 
      barriers and facilitators to the treatment of AUD in the ED, and to design 
      interventions to address identified barriers. METHODS: Using an implementation 
      science approach based on the Behavior Change Wheel framework, we conducted 
      qualitative interviews with staff to interrogate their perspectives on ED 
      initiation of AUD treatment. Subjects included physicians, nurses, nurse 
      practitioners, clinical social workers, and pharmacists. Interviews were 
      thematically coded using both inductive and deductive approaches and constant 
      comparative analysis. Themes were further categorized as relating to providers' 
      capabilities, opportunities, or motivations. Barriers were then mapped to 
      corresponding intervention functions. RESULTS: Facilitators at our institution 
      included time allotted for continuing education, the availability of clinical 
      social workers, and favorable opinions of MAT based on previous experiences 
      implementing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Capability barriers included 
      limited familiarity with naltrexone and difficulty determining which patients are 
      candidates for therapy. Opportunity barriers included the limited supply of 
      naltrexone and a lack of clarity as to who should introduce naltrexone and assess 
      readiness for change. Motivation barriers included a sense of futility in 
      treating patients with AUD and stigmas associated with alcohol use. 
      Evidence-based interventions included multi-modal provider education, a 
      standardized treatment algorithm and order set, selection of clinical champions, 
      and clarification of roles among providers on the team. CONCLUSIONS: A large 
      evidence-practice gap exists for the treatment of AUD with Naltrexone, and the ED 
      visit is a missed opportunity for intervention. ED providers are optimistic about 
      implementing AUD treatment in the ED but described many barriers, especially 
      related to knowledge, clarification of roles, and stigma associated with AUD. 
      Applying a formal implementation science approach guided by the Behavior Change 
      Wheel allowed us to transform qualitative interview data into evidence-based 
      interventions for the implementation of an ED-based program for the treatment of 
      AUD.

      Reversal.
PG  - E2
LID - 10.1097/JAN.0000000000000467 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Law enforcement officers (LEO) often are the first responders to 
      arrive at a scene of an opioid overdose. Thus, equipping LEOs as first responders 
      with naloxone is necessary to prevent overdose deaths, and a recommended 
      strategy. However, little is known about how LEOs perceive naloxone training and 
      their feelings after using naloxone to save a life. It is important to understand 
      LEO’s experiences with naloxone so as to develop additional training materials 
      that are relevant to the LEO experience. METHODS: A descriptive exploratory study 
      was conducted to explore the perceptions of LEOs about using naloxone in the 
      field and to identify areas that should be included in future naloxone trainings. 
      Interview data were obtained through face-to-face interviews with LEOs (N=14) and 
      analyzed using manifest content analysis. RESULTS: LEOs changed their attitudes 
      and beliefs toward naloxone after receiving training and experiencing a 
      successful resuscitation. The change in attitudes was enhanced after saving a 
      life. However, misconceptions about naloxone and lack of understanding about 
      disease of addiction persisted even after training. CONCLUSION: Future naloxone 
      curriculum could benefit from additional lessons on the stigma of addiction, the 
      disease of addiction, misconceptions about the safety of naloxone, strategies for 
      post-overdose responses, and the role naloxone might play in a hopeful recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate community attitudes concerning syringe exchange programs 
      (SEPs) in a rural community as part of an effort to implement evidence-based harm 
      reduction strategies and improve health outcomes related to opioid use disorder. 
      METHODS: Dissemination of a 24-item survey to individuals living in a rural 
      community followed by comparative analysis of survey results based on support for 
      SEPs. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-one individuals responded. Overall, 49.3% 
      of respondents indicated support for syringe exchange. Individuals who support 
      syringe exchange as a harm reduction service are more likely to: agree that 
      opioid use disorder is a real illness (p < 0.0001); agree that anyone can become 
      addicted to pain medications (p = 0.01); agree that medication assisted treatment 
      is effective (p < 0.0001); agree that individuals with OUD have the same right to 
      a job (p < 0.0001); be willing to administer naloxone to a stranger (p < 0.0001); 
      support HIV and HCV screening (p < 0.0001), condom distribution (p < 0.0001), and 
      medication for opioid use disorder (p < 0.0001). They are less likely to believe 
      that harm reduction services encourage drug use (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Positive correlations exist between support for SEPs, awareness of OUD as a 
      chronic illness, less stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals with OUD, and 
      support for other harm reduction strategies. Efforts to increase awareness of OUD 
      as a chronic illness may lead to greater acceptance of harm reduction strategies 
      in rural areas, easing evolution of evidence-based healthy policy.

TI  - Naloxone protection, social support, network characteristics, and overdose 
      experiences among a cohort of people who use illicit opioids in New York City.
PG  - 20

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased availability of take-home naloxone, many people who 
      use opioids do so in unprotected contexts, with no other person who might 
      administer naloxone present, increasing the likelihood that an overdose will 
      result in death. Thus, there is a social nature to being "protected" from 
      overdose mortality, which highlights the importance of identifying background 
      factors that promote access to protective social networks among people who use 
      opioids. METHODS: We used respondent-driven sampling to recruit adults residing 
      in New York City who reported recent (past 3-day) nonmedical opioid use 
      (n = 575). Participants completed a baseline assessment that included past 30-day 
      measures of substance use, overdose experiences, and number of "protected" opioid 
      use events, defined as involving naloxone and the presence of another person who 
      could administer it, as well as measures of network characteristics and social 
      support. We used modified Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate 
      unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs). RESULTS: 66% of participants had ever been trained to administer naloxone, 
      18% had used it in the past three months, and 32% had experienced a recent 
      overdose (past 30 days). During recent opioid use events, 64% reported never 
      having naloxone and a person to administer present. This was more common among 
      those: aged ≥ 50 years (PR: 1.18 (CI 1.03, 1.34); who identified as non-Hispanic 
      Black (PR: 1.27 (CI 1.05, 1.53); experienced higher levels of stigma 
      consciousness (PR: 1.13 (CI 1.00, 1.28); and with small social networks (< 5 
      persons) (APR: 1.14 (CI 0.98, 1.31). Having a recent overdose experience was 
      associated with severe opioid use disorder (PR: 2.45 (CI 1.49, 4.04), suicidality 
      (PR: 1.72 (CI 1.19, 2.49), depression (PR: 1.54 (CI 1.20, 1.98) and positive 
      urinalysis result for benzodiazepines (PR: 1.56 (CI 1.23, 1.96), but not with 
      network size. CONCLUSIONS: Results show considerable gaps in naloxone protection 
      among people who use opioids, with more vulnerable and historically disadvantaged 
      subpopulations less likely to be protected. Larger social networks of people who 
      use opioids may be an important resource to curtail overdose mortality, but more 
      effort is needed to harness the protective aspects of social networks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical settings provide ideal opportunities to identify patients 
      with substance use disorders and provide harm reduction and treatment resources. 
      Medical students often volunteer in the community and can spend substantial time 
      with patients, serving as touchpoints. Accordingly, medical schools have begun 
      training in harm reduction. Initial studies show such training acutely improves 
      knowledge, but sustained effects remain unclear. This pilot study explored 
      longer-term impacts of Opioid Overdose Prevention and Response Training (OOPRT) 
      on medical student knowledge about opioids, overdose, and naloxone. METHODS: 
      Students completed a survey about knowledge of opioid use disorder, overdoses, 
      and attitudes towards patients. This included Opioid Overdose Knowledge (OOKS) 
      and Opioid Overdose Attitudes (OOAS) scales. A subset of students was invited to 
      attend OOPRT and complete a post-training survey. All who completed the baseline 
      survey were invited to complete a 6-month follow-up. We analyzed long-term 
      training effects on OOKS and OOAS scores. RESULTS: 89 students completed baseline 
      and 6-month follow-up surveys; of these, 22 received training. OOPRT yielded 
      significant improvements in knowledge of signs of opioid overdose 
      (F(2,38) = 18.04, P < .001), actions to take during overdose (F(2,38) = 8.32, 
      P = .001), and naloxone use (F(2,38) = 35.46, P < .001), along with attitudes 
      regarding overdose competencies (F(2,38) = 99.40, P < .001) and concerns 
      (F(2,38) = 8.86, P < .001). When comparing over time, students who attended OOPRT 
      retained significantly higher competency scores than those who did not attend 
      F(1,87) = 40.82, P < .001). No other significant differences were observed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates immediate efficacy of OOPRT in improving 
      opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes and sustained changes at 6 months, 
      compared to standard undergraduate medical curricula alone. Future research with 
      larger sample sizes is underway to validate these preliminary findings and 
      examine the difference in attitudes and knowledge retention over time. Given that 
      students report interest in receiving OOPRT and consider it worthwhile, 
      systematic study is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid-related drug overdoses have been rapidly increasing in the 
      United States, especially in rural Southern and Appalachian regions. The use of 
      buprenorphine-containing medications to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) is an 
      evidence-based approach proven to reduce overdose death risks. Access to such 
      treatment is uneven, with less access in parts of the United States where 
      overdose rates are higher. Pharmacy dispensing of buprenorphine is a key 
      component of access, yet barriers related to perceived and actual regulatory 
      constraints, training gaps, stigma, and challenges to prescriber-pharmacist 
      communication limit dispensing of this life-saving medication. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objectives of this study were to explore the experiences of rural patients with 
      OUD filling prescriptions for buprenorphine-containing medications at community 
      pharmacies. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Rural community pharmacies, both commercial 
      chain and independent, in 2 rural South-Central Appalachian counties where the 
      local health departments prescribe buprenorphine-containing medications. PRACTICE 
      INNOVATION: The local county health departments each entered into dedicated 
      dispensing arrangements with a local independent community pharmacy to ensure a 
      stable supply of medication for their patients with OUD who were prescribed 
      buprenorphine. EVALUATION METHODS: Qualitative interviews (n =16) with patients 
      prescribed buprenorphine from their county health department; county health 
      department staff, local harm reduction program staff, and harm reduction program 
      participants prescribed buprenorphine. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported problems with buprenorphine dispensing 
      at rural community pharmacies, dispensing delays that resulted in experiencing 
      withdrawal symptoms and hesitation to continue in treatment, high medication 
      costs, and stigmatizing treatment by some pharmacists. Participants also reported 
      that access improved after dedicated dispensing arrangements began. CONCLUSION: 
      Agreements between prescribing health departments and community pharmacies could 
      increase access to buprenorphine, especially in rural areas.

TI  - Addiction stigma and the production of impediments to take-home naloxone uptake.
PG  - 139-161
LID - 10.1177/1363459320925863 [doi]
AB  - Opioid overdose deaths are a major health issue in Australia and around the 
      world. Programmes to provide opioid consumers with 'take-home' naloxone to 
      reverse overdose exist internationally, but uptake by mainstream health services 
      and consumers remains inconsistent. Researchers have identified a range of 
      important educational, training and logistical impediments to take-home naloxone 
      uptake and distribution, yet they have focused less on the social dynamics that 
      can enhance or limit access, such as stigma. In this article, we also explore 
      impediments to uptake, drawing on qualitative interview data gathered for an 
      Australian research project on take-home naloxone. Mobilising a performative 
      approach to stigma, we argue that overdose and prevention are shaped by the 
      social dynamics of stigma and, as such, responsibility for dealing with overdose, 
      as with take-home naloxone, should also be considered social (i.e. shared among 
      peers, the public, communities and governments). Our interview data illuminate 
      the various ways in which addiction stigma limits the possibilities and 
      capacities of take-home naloxone and overdose prevention. First, we focus on how 
      stigma may impede professional information provision about take-home naloxone by 
      limiting the extent to which it is presented as a matter of interest for all 
      opioid consumers, not just those who consume opioids illicitly. Second, we 
      explore how stigma may limit the scale-up and expansion of programmes and access 
      points. From here, we focus on how stigma co-constitutes the politics of overdose 
      and prevention, rendering take-home naloxone ill-suited to many social settings 
      of overdose. In closing, we point out that stigma is not just a post hoc 
      impediment to access to and use of take-home naloxone but is central to opioid 
      overdose production itself, and to effective prevention. While take-home naloxone 
      is an excellent life-saving initiative, uncritically valorising it may divert 
      attention from broader goals, such as the de-stigmatisation of drug consumption 
      through decriminalisation, and other ambitious attempts to reduce overdose.

TI  - How do naloxone-based interventions work to reduce overdose deaths: a realist 
      review.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/s12954-022-00599-4 [doi]
LID - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Naloxone-based interventions as part of health systems can reverse an 
      opioid overdose. Previous systematic reviews have identified the effectiveness of 
      naloxone; however, the role of context and mechanisms for its use has not been 
      explored. This realist systematic review aims to identify a theory of how 
      naloxone works based on the contexts and mechanisms that contribute to the 
      success of the intervention for improved outcomes. METHODS: Pre-registered at 
      PROSPERO, this realist review followed RAMESES standards of reporting. Keywords 
      included 'naloxone' and ' opioid overdose'. All study designs were included. Data 
      extraction using 55 relevant outputs based on realist logic produced evidence of 
      two middle-range theories: Naloxone Bystander Intervention Theory and Skills 
      Transfer Theory. RESULTS: Harm reduction and/or low threshold contexts provide a 
      non-judgemental approach which support in-group norms of helping and empower the 
      social identity of the trained and untrained bystander. This context also creates 
      the conditions necessary for skills transfer and diffusion of the intervention 
      into social networks. Stigma and negative attitudes held by first responders and 
      stakeholders involved in the implementation process, such as police or GPs, can 
      prohibit the bystander response by inducing fear in responding. This interferes 
      with skills transfer, naloxone use and carriage of naloxone kits. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The findings provide theoretically informed guidance regarding the harm 
      reduction contexts that are essential for the successful implementation of 
      naloxone-based interventions. Peer-to-peer models of training are helpful as it 
      reinforces social identity and successful skills transfer between bystanders. 
      Health systems may want to assess the prevalence of, and take steps to reduce 
      opioid-related stigma with key stakeholders in contexts using a low threshold 
      training approach to build an environment  to support positive naloxone outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-based addiction care focuses on assessing and diagnosing 
      substance use disorders, managing withdrawal, and initiating medications for 
      addiction treatment. Hospital harm reduction is generally limited to prescribing 
      naloxone. Hospitals can better serve individuals with substance use disorders by 
      incorporating harm reduction education and equipment provision as essential 
      addiction care. We describe the implementation of a hospital intervention that 
      provides harm reduction education and equipment (e.g., syringes, pipes, and 
      fentanyl test strips) to patients via an addiction consult team in an urban, 
      safety-net hospital. METHODS: We performed a needs assessment to determine 
      patient harm reduction needs. We partnered with a community-based organization 
      who provided us harm reduction equipment and training. We engaged executive, 
      regulatory, and nursing leadership to obtain support. After ensuring regulatory 
      compliance, training our team, and developing a workflow, we implemented this 
      harm reduction program that provides education and equipment to individuals whose 
      substance use goals do not include abstinence. RESULTS: During a 12-month period 
      we provided 195 individuals harm reduction kits. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention 
      allowed us to advance hospital-based addiction care, better educate and engage 
      patients, staff, and clinicians, and reduce stigma. By establishing a community 
      harm reduction partner, obtaining support from hospital leadership, and 
      incorporating feedback from staff, clinicians, and patients, we successfully 
      implemented harm reduction education and equipment provision in a hospital 
      setting as part of evidence-based addiction care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Commentary,

TI  - Protocol for the Optimizing Naloxone Dispensing in Pharmacies (ONDP) Online 
      Continuing Education Program: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy10010024 [doi]
LID - 24
AB  - The number of opioid-related deaths in Canada has steadily increased since 2016 
      and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened this trend. Naloxone has been pivotal for 
      reducing opioid-related harms and death, and pharmacists play a crucial role in 
      ensuring the supply of naloxone to Canadians through community pharmacies. 
      However, naloxone dispensing by pharmacists is not optimal; in fact, in Ontario, 
      only 50% of pharmacists offer naloxone, despite national guidelines that 
      pharmacists should offer naloxone to everyone with an opioid prescription. When 
      asked why pharmacists do not proactively offer naloxone, recent research has 
      identified that pharmacists need continuing education to boost confidence and 
      knowledge on how to start conversations with patients. The study involves a 
      delayed start, double-blind randomized controlled trial, for Canadian licensed 
      pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. The goals of the program are to increase 
      Canadian pharmacy professional's knowledge, confidence, and motivation to 
      proactively offer naloxone, as well as to decrease stigma associated with 
      naloxone. The program incorporates behaviour change techniques from the 
      Theoretical Domains Framework and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The 
      intervention program includes three modules that focus on improving pharmacists' 
      communication skills by teaching them how to proactively offer naloxone, while 
      the control group will complete a reading assignment on the naloxone consensus 
      guidelines. The program will involve a process and outcome evaluation in addition 
      to a contribution analysis. This program is important for breaking down 
      previously identified barriers and knowledge gaps for why pharmacists currently 
      do not proactively offer naloxone. This study will provide important new 
      information about what behaviour change techniques are successful in improving 
      confidence and motivation in the pharmacy profession and in an online 
      environment. Findings from this study can be used to produce a national naloxone 
      education program that can also be implemented into current pharmacy school 
      curriculum.

TI  - Pharmacists and opioid use disorder care during COVID-19: Call for action.
PG  - 203-213
LID - 10.1002/jac5.1556 [doi]
AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by 
      problematic opioid use causing significant impairment in daily life. Medication 
      for opioid use disorder using buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone with 
      behavioral therapy reduces illicit opioid use and risk of overdose death. Despite 
      evidence and decades of experience, barriers limit access to treatment and care 
      for individuals with OUD. Barriers include a lack of treatment centers 
      particularly in rural areas, regulations on buprenorphine prescribing, and stigma 
      from the community and health care professionals. While many barriers are 
      longstanding, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-forced isolation 
      and associated stress has exacerbated challenges for individuals with mental 
      health conditions such as OUD. Pharmacists are well-positioned to bridge existing 
      gaps in OUD care, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roles for 
      pharmacists include OUD risk identification and screening, referral of patients 
      to treatment and support programs, ensuring medication access, expanding naloxone 
      access, and advocacy initiatives. This review article identifies barriers to care 
      for patients with OUD during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores opportunities and 
      resources for pharmacists to improve OUD care during the pandemic and beyond.

TI  - The impact of family engagement in opioid assisted treatment: Results from a 
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 166-170
LID - 10.1177/0020764020979026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family interventions in substance use disorders (SUD) treatment is 
      limited despite the evidence for benefits. Providing family interventions is 
      hampered by patient resistance, social stigma, logistics and factors related to 
      the capacity of the treatment programmes. AIMS: The purpose of the study was to 
      examine the association between family engagement in treatment, and opioid use 
      defined by percentage negative opioid screen and rate retention in treatment 
      defined by completion of study period. METHODS: Data from a 16-week outpatient 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 141 adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) 
      receiving Opioid Assisted Treatment (OAT) using buprenorphine/naloxone film 
      (BUP/NX-F) was, used to examine the association between family engagement in and 
      opioid use and rate of retention in treatment. Multiple logistic regression was, 
      applied to examine the independent prediction of family engagement on opioid use 
      and rate retention in treatment. RESULTS: Family engagement was significantly 
      associated with retention in treatment (Spearman's rho 0.25, p < 0.01) and was 
      subsequently found to increase the likelihood of retention in treatment by 
      approximately 3-fold (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.31-6.65). 
      CONCLUSION: Family engagement in treatment is an independent predictor of 
      retention in treatment but not opioid use in adults receiving OAT. It is, 
      recommended that SUD treatment programmes integrate family related interventions 
      in mainstream treatment. Delivering a personalised multicomponent family 
      programme using digitised virtual communications that has been increasingly 
      utilised during the Covid-19 pandemic is highly suggested.

TI  - Perspectives of Stakeholders of Equitable Access to Community Naloxone Programs: 
      A Literature Review.
PG  - e21461
LID - 10.7759/cureus.21461 [doi]
LID - e21461
AB  - The purpose of this review is to examine the existing literature about 
      facilitators and barriers influencing equitable access to naloxone programs by 
      individuals who use opioids. A total of 49 published articles were examined, 
      which generated four overarching themes:(1) Stigma as a barrier to access; (2) 
      Lack of a wide range of stakeholder perspectives; (3) Need for a comprehensive 
      understanding of factors affecting equitable access to naloxone programs; (4) 
      Facilitators to increase the access of community naloxone programs. Our review 
      highlighted the importance of advocacy in practice, education, administration, 
      and policy to address the health inequities that exist in naloxone distribution 
      programs. Advocacy activities involve the need for health care professionals to 
      engage in social justice practice through evidence-based informed research about 
      the facts of opioid use; challenging the stigma toward victim-blaming against 
      naloxone users; as well as promoting program development and health policy to 
      bring about equitable access to naloxone programs by marginalized and socially 
      disadvantaged populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic is a rapidly growing public health concern in the 
      USA, as the number of overdose deaths continues to increase each year. One 
      strategy for combating the rising number of overdoses is through opioid overdose 
      prevention programs (OOPPs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an 
      innovative OOPP, with changes in knowledge and attitudes serving as the primary 
      outcome measures. METHODS: The OOPP was developed by a group of medical students 
      under guidance from faculty advisors. Training sessions focused on understanding 
      stigmatizing factors of opioid use disorder (OUD), as well as protocols for 
      opioid overdose reversal through naloxone administration. Pre- and post-surveys 
      were partially adapted from the opioid overdose attitudes and knowledge scales 
      and administered to all participants. Paired t-tests were conducted to assess 
      differences between pre- and post-surveys. RESULTS: A total of 440 individuals 
      participated in the training; 381 completed all or the majority of the survey. 
      Participants came from a diverse set of backgrounds, ages, and experiences. All 
      three knowledge questions showed significant improvements. For attitude 
      questions, significant improvements were found in all three questions evaluating 
      confidence, two of three questions assessing attitudes towards overdose reversal, 
      and four of five questions evaluating stigma and attitudes towards individuals 
      with OUD. CONCLUSIONS: Our innovative OOPP was effective not only in increasing 
      knowledge but also in improving attitudes towards overdose reversal and reducing 
      stigma towards individuals with OUD. Given the strong improvements in attitudes 
      towards those with OUD, efforts should be made to incorporate the unique focus on 
      biopsychosocial and sociohistorical components into future OOPPs.

TI  - Attitudes toward Medication for Opioid Use Disorder among Substance Use Treatment 
      Providers.
PG  - 1828-1836
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2022.2115853 [doi]
AB  - Background: Provider attitudes can be a powerful reinforcer of stigma toward 
      medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). This study examines attitudes toward 
      MOUD among substance use treatment providers and identifies personal and 
      professional characteristics associated with more positive attitudes. Methods: 
      Treatment providers (N = 570) working at publicly-funded substance use programs 
      in Michigan self-administered a web-based survey (November 2020 through July 
      2021), reporting their socio-demographics, professional experience, and attitudes 
      toward MOUD. Linear regression was used to identify factors associated with 
      general attitudes toward MOUD and three logistic regression models were 
      calculated to identify factors associated with perceptions of each medication. 
      Results: Half of providers considered methadone an effective treatment (53.0%); 
      62.9% considered buprenorphine effective, and 70.3% considered naltrexone 
      effective. Receipt of training (B = 1.433, p = .009) and serving pregnant women 
      or women with children (B = 1.662, p < .001) were associated with more positive 
      attitudes toward MOUD. Providers with advanced degrees were more likely to 
      consider methadone (OR = 2.264, p = .006), buprenorphine (OR = 2.192, p = .009), 
      and naltrexone (OR = 2.310, p = .011) effective. Rural providers were more likely 
      to consider naltrexone effective (OR = 2.708, p = .003). Providers working with 
      criminal legal populations were more likely to consider buprenorphine (OR = 
      2.948, p = .041) and naltrexone (OR = 4.108, p = .010) effective, but not 
      methadone. Conclusion: Treatment providers' attitudes remain poorly aligned with 
      the evidence base. Increased efforts are needed to address attitudes toward MOUD 
      among the specialized treatment workforce.

TI  - Coverage of the opioid crisis in national network television news from 2000-2020: 
      A content analysis.
PG  - 1322-1332
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2022.2074594 [doi]
AB  - Background: News coverage has both negatively and positively influenced public 
      awareness and perceptions surrounding the opioid crisis. This study aimed to 
      describe and analyze national network television news framing of the scope and 
      impact of the opioid crisis in the United States. Methods: We performed a 
      retrospective content analysis on national network television evening news 
      segments covering the opioid crisis from 1/2000 to 8/2020, which were obtained 
      from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive. The database was queried for: opioid 
      epidemic, oxycontin, heroin, fentanyl, and naloxone. Two independent reviewers 
      quantitatively coded segment characteristics, including theme, geographic 
      location, opioids mentioned, strategies for combatting the epidemic discussed, 
      interviews conducted, and patient demographics. Changes in segment 
      characteristics over time were analyzed using chi-square analyses and Fisher's 
      exact tests. Results: News segments (N = 191) most commonly provided an overview 
      of the epidemic (55.5%) and/or conveyed personal stories (40.3%). Prescription 
      opioids (59.7%) and heroin (62.8%) were more often referenced than fentanyl 
      (17.8%); the focus on heroin peaked in 2011-2015 (84.8%), while references to 
      fentanyl significantly increased over time (p = 0.021). The most frequently 
      interviewed people included patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) (47.1%), 
      healthcare providers (36.7%), family members/friends (31.9%), and law enforcement 
      (30.9%). Most of the featured patients with OUD were male (63.0%), white (88.4%), 
      and young (< 40 years) adults (77.9%). Coverage of the crisis peaked in 2016. 
      Conclusions: Evening news segments' emphasis on personal stories, while 
      emotionally compelling, came at the cost of thematically-framed coverage that may 
      improve public understanding of the complexities of the epidemic. The depiction 
      of primarily white, young adult patients with OUD revealed a need for a greater 
      emphasis in the news on underrepresented minorities and older adults, as these 
      populations face additional stigma and disparities in OUD treatment initiation 
      and retention.

TI  - First Responders' Views of Naloxone: Does Stigma Matter?
PG  - 1534-1544
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2022.2092150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior work has suggested that first responders have mixed feelings 
      about harm reduction strategies used to fight the opioid epidemic, such as the 
      use of naloxone to reverse opioid overdose. Researchers have also noted that 
      provider-based stigma of people who use opioids (PWUO) may influence perceptions 
      of appropriate interventions for opioid use disorder (OUD). This study examined 
      first responders' perceptions of naloxone and the relationship between stigma of 
      OUD and perceptions of naloxone. METHODS: A web-based survey assessing 
      perceptions of PWUO and naloxone was administered to 282 police officers and 
      students enrolled in EMT and paramedic training courses located in the 
      Northeastern United States. Bivariate and multivariable analyses assessed the 
      relationship between variants of stigma (e.g., perceived dangerousness, blame, 
      social distance, and fatalism) and self-reported perceptions of naloxone. 
      RESULTS: Participants, in the aggregate, held slightly negative attitudes toward 
      the use of naloxone. Findings from multivariable modeling suggest that stigma of 
      OUD, living in a rural area, and prior experience administering naloxone, were 
      significantly and inversely related to support for the use of naloxone. Support 
      for the disease model of addiction and associating drug use with low 
      socioeconomic status were positively related to support for the use of naloxone. 
      CONCLUSION: Efforts to alleviate perceptions of PWUO as dangerous, blameworthy, 
      or incapable of recovery may increase first responders' support for naloxone. To 
      this end, first responder training programs should include instruction on the 
      disease model of addiction, and more broadly, attempt to foster familiarity 
      between PWUO and the professionals who serve them.

TI  - Opioid harm reduction: A scoping review of physician and system-level gaps in 
      knowledge, education, and practice.
PG  - 972-987
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2022.2060423 [doi]
AB  - Background: Harm reduction includes treatment and prevention approaches rather 
      than abstinence, as a public health strategy for mitigating the opioid epidemic. 
      Harm reduction is a new strategy for many healthcare professionals, and gaps in 
      knowledge and practices may lead to barriers to optimal treatment. Our objective 
      was to identify and describe gaps in physicians' knowledge, education, and 
      practice in harm reduction strategies related to opioid overdose. Methods: We 
      searched the PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for articles published 
      between 2015 and 2021, published in English, containing empirical evidence, 
      addressing opioid harm reduction, and identifying gaps in physicians' knowledge, 
      education, or practice. Results: Thirty-seven studies were included. Studies 
      examined how physicians' perceptions or stigma influenced harm reduction efforts 
      and addressed clinical knowledge gaps in overdose treatment and prevention and 
      OUD treatment. Less than half of the studies addressed access issues at the 
      system level, above the individual healthcare professional. Conclusion: 
      Individual-level interventions should be addressed with professional continuing 
      education and curricular-based changes through experiential and interprofessional 
      education. System-level gaps can be remedied by increasing patient access to 
      care, creating policies favorable to harm reduction, and extending resources to 
      provide harm reduction strategies.

TI  - Study protocol for the Respond to Prevent Study: a multi-state randomized 
      controlled trial to improve provision of naloxone, buprenorphine and 
      nonprescription syringes in community pharmacies.
PG  - 901-905
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2021.2010162 [doi]
AB  - Access to the opioid antidote naloxone is a critical component of addressing the 
      opioid crisis. Naloxone is a population-level prevention intervention associated 
      with substantial reductions in overdose mortality and reduction of nonfatal 
      overdose. Pharmacies' pivotal role in dispensing medications like buprenorphine 
      for the treatment of opioid use disorder and selling nonprescription syringes 
      places them at the crossroads of opioid access and risk mitigation methods like 
      naloxone provision. Testing ways to optimize pharmacy-based naloxone provision 
      will be key as the country expands the implementation of naloxone through the 
      medical system. In the Respond to Prevent Study, we conducted a large, practical 
      study of a pharmacy-focused intervention in a sample of Washington, Oregon, 
      Massachusetts and New Hampshire community chain pharmacies to increase naloxone 
      dispensing and improve opioid safety. The intervention integrated two 
      evidence-based educational toolkits and streamlined materials to enhance the 
      focus on naloxone policy, stigma reduction, and patient communications around 
      naloxone, nonprescription syringes and buprenorphine access. The real-world study 
      implemented a stepped wedge, clustered randomized trial design across 175 
      community chain pharmacies to evaluate the effectiveness of the Respond to 
      Prevent intervention in increasing: (a) pharmacy based naloxone distribution 
      rates, naloxone-related patient engagement, and pharmacist and technicians' 
      attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy toward 
      naloxone; and (b) pharmacy nonprescription syringe sales, and pharmacist and 
      technicians' attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy 
      toward dispensing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (secondary outcomes). 
      This commentary provides a brief narrative about the study and presents insights 
      on the design and adaptations to our study protocol, including those adopted 
      during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic further compounded by Western 
      wildfires in 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The United States is experiencing an opioid crisis, substantially 
      worsened by the pandemic. Pharmacists play a critical role in expanding access to 
      care through harm reduction efforts and medications to treat opioid use disorder 
      (mOUD), yet lack necessary education and resources. Academic detailing is a 
      one-on-one technique, which can effectively address educational gaps. OBJECTIVE: 
      The purpose was to assess needs and equip pharmacy staff to address the health of 
      people with substance use disorders (SUD). PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Community 
      pharmacists provide ongoing care for patients with SUD. PRACTICE INNOVATION: 
      Based on needs' assessment findings, an academic detailing program was designed 
      to provide education and resources for community pharmacies. The project sought 
      to assess current practice and needs and address pharmacists' skills in managing 
      patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or at risk for overdose (OD). Visits 
      were scheduled in high-risk regions. Coaching and materials were provided. 
      EVALUATION METHODS: Detailers completed visits reports. Discrete variables were 
      reported using descriptive statistics. Associations between discrete variables 
      were detected with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Detailers visited 
      136 pharmacies. Most stocked naloxone (86.8%), mOUD (94.9%) and would sell 
      syringes (64%) per state law. Fifty-seven percent of pharmacies provided all of 
      these services. However, additional education and resources were needed. Only 
      27.9% had naloxone signage and/or handouts; 22.1% had supplemental materials; and 
      25% had referral information. When asked to explain barriers, frequently cited 
      themes included providing resources/help, financial issues, stigma, and 
      transportation. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists routinely care for patients at risk for 
      OD and diagnosed with OUD. Academic detailing is a well-received strategy to 
      disseminate education and materials, while gathering information about pharmacist 
      needs and barriers. However, there remains room for expansion of services and 
      opportunities for improved care. Further efforts should incorporate ongoing 
      training and access to materials with visual cues, as well as referral and cost 
      savings information.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In a prior statewide naloxone purchase trial conducted in 
      Massachusetts, we documented a high rate of naloxone dispensing under the state's 
      standing order program. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors 
      that facilitate naloxone access under the Massachusetts naloxone standing order 
      (NSO) program and identify any remaining barriers amenable to intervention. 
      DESIGN: Mixed methods design involving a pharmacist survey and 3 pharmacist focus 
      groups. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Focus groups were conducted at 3 separate 
      professional conferences for pharmacists (n = 27). The survey was conducted among 
      Massachusetts pharmacists (n = 339) working at a stratified random sample chain 
      and independent retail pharmacies across Massachusetts. All data were collected 
      between September 2018 and November 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: Facilitators and 
      barriers to NSO implementation and naloxone dispensing and pharmacists' attitudes 
      and beliefs regarding naloxone and opioid use. RESULTS: Most pharmacists 
      described NSO implementation as being straightforward, although differences were 
      reported by pharmacy type in both the survey and focus groups. Facilitators 
      included centralized implementation at chain pharmacies, access to Web-based 
      resources, regularly stocking naloxone, and use of naloxone-specific intake 
      forms. Barriers included patient confidentiality concerns and payment/cost 
      issues. Only 31% of surveyed pharmacists reported always providing naloxone 
      counseling; the most commonly cited barriers were perceived patient discomfort 
      (21%) and time limitations (14%). Confidential space was also more of a concern 
      for independent (vs. chain) pharmacists (18% vs. 6%, P = 0.008). A majority of 
      pharmacists held supportive attitudes toward naloxone, although some reported 
      having moral/ethical concerns about naloxone provision. CONCLUSION: We documented 
      several facilitators to NSO implementation and naloxone dispensing. Areas for 
      improvement include addressing stigma and misconceptions around opioids and 
      naloxone use. These remain important targets for improving pharmacy-based 
      naloxone dispensing, although our overall positive results suggest Massachusetts' 
      experience with NSO implementation can inform other states' efforts to expand 
      pharmacy-based naloxone access.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone medications are among the most 
      effective treatment options for opioid use disorders, yet many people remain 
      misinformed about their benefits and hold negative perceptions about the use of 
      medications to treat opioid use disorders. Such perceptions, especially negative 
      perceptions based on misinformation, may be especially harmful or stigmatizing 
      within the context of disclosure (i.e., telling another about one's opioid use 
      disorder history or treatment), inhibiting important recovery outcomes and 
      sources of social support. METHODS: Therefore, using the Disclosure Process Model 
      as a framework, the current study seeks to characterize and compare participants' 
      perceptions of stigmatizing reactions to their disclosures of MOUD use that stem 
      from misinformation about methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. Participants 
      included people who are actively receiving MOUD as treatment. RESULTS: Results 
      suggest that participants (N = 52) receiving both types of medications 
      experienced similar stigmatizing reactions to disclosures. Participants also 
      reported treatment consequences of misinformed reactions to their disclosure, 
      such as dropping out of support groups (e.g., Narcotics Anonymous) or prematurely 
      ending their medication use. Further, the paper provides participants' 
      recommendations for avoiding or managing misinformed disclosure reactions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Short-term intervention efforts may promote strategies to manage 
      misinformation, equipping individuals to respond to misinformation surrounding 
      their medication use. Long-term interventions may target misinformation about 
      methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone medications to increase health literacy, 
      reduce stigma, and combat cultural ambivalence within communities, as well as 
      promote recovery among people receiving medications for opioid use disorder.

TI  - Police discretion in encounters with people who use drugs: operationalizing the 
      theory of planned behavior.
PG  - 132
LID - 10.1186/s12954-021-00583-4 [doi]
LID - 132
AB  - BACKGROUND: Policing shapes the health risks of people who use drugs (PWUD), but 
      little is understood about interventions that can align officer practices with 
      PWUD health. This study deploys the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to 
      understand what influences police intentions to make discretionary referrals to 
      treatment and harm reduction resources rather than arrest on less serious 
      charges. METHODS: On-line surveys integrating TPB constructs and adapting an 
      instrument measuring police intentions to make mental health treatment referrals 
      were completed by police employees in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Missouri. They 
      also included items about stigma towards PWUD and attitudes and beliefs about 
      opioid addiction, treatment, and recovery. FINDINGS: Across the sites, 259 
      respondents perceived control over their decision to arrest for misdemeanors 
      (69%) and confiscate items such as syringes (56%). Beliefs about others' approval 
      of referrals to treatment, its ability to reduce future arrests, and to increase 
      trust in police were associated with stated practices of nonarrest for drug and 
      possession and making referrals (p ≤ .001), and nonarrest for syringe possession 
      (p ≤ .05). Stigma a towards PWUD was negatively associated with stated practices 
      of nonarrest (p ≤ .05). Respondents identified supervisors as having the most 
      influence over use of discretion, seriousness of the offense as the most 
      influential value, and attitude of the suspect as the most important situational 
      factor. The 17 Likert scale items analyzed had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.81. 
      CONCLUSION: The TPB offers untapped potential to better understand and modify 
      police practices. In designing interventions to improve the health outcomes of 
      police encounters with PWUD, further research should validate instruments that 
      measure the relationship between these variables and discretionary intentions, 
      and that measure role-relevant police stigma towards PWUD.

TI  - Studying how state health services delivery policies can mitigate the effects of 
      disasters on drug addiction treatment and overdose: Protocol for a mixed-methods 
      study.
PG  - e0261115
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0261115 [doi]
LID - e0261115
AB  - BACKGROUND: The United States is experiencing a drug addiction and overdose 
      crisis, made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. Relative to other types of health 
      services, addiction treatment and overdose prevention services are particularly 
      vulnerable to disaster-related disruptions for multiple reasons including 
      fragmentation from the general medical system and stigma, which may lead 
      decisionmakers and providers to de-prioritize these services during disasters. In 
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. states implemented multiple policies 
      designed to mitigate disruptions to addiction treatment and overdose prevention 
      services, for example policies expanding access to addiction treatment delivered 
      via telehealth and policies designed to support continuity of naloxone 
      distribution programs. There is limited evidence on the effects of these policies 
      on addiction treatment and overdose. This evidence is needed to inform state 
      policy design in future disasters, as well as to inform decisions regarding 
      whether to sustain these policies post-pandemic. METHODS: The overall study uses 
      a concurrent-embedded design. Aims 1-2 use difference-in-differences analyses of 
      large-scale observational databases to examine how state policies designed to 
      mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health services delivery 
      influenced addiction treatment delivery and overdose during the pandemic. Aim 3 
      uses a qualitative embedded multiple case study approach, in which we 
      characterize local implementation of the state policies of interest; most public 
      health disaster policies are enacted at the state level but implemented at the 
      local level by healthcare systems and local public health authorities. 
      DISCUSSION: Triangulation of results across methods will yield robust 
      understanding of whether and how state disaster-response policies influenced drug 
      addiction treatment and overdose during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results will 
      inform policy enactment and implementation in future public health disasters. 
      Results will also inform decisions about whether to sustain COVID-19 
      pandemic-related changes to policies governing delivery addiction and overdose 
      prevention services long-term.

      investigation in South-Central Appalachia.
PG  - 100082

LID - 100082
AB  - BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine access is limited for patients with opioid use 
      disorder, especially in rural areas. Telephone audits have identified pharmacist 
      limitations to the dispensing of buprenorphine particularly in independent 
      pharmacies in comparison to chain pharmacies and in rural areas. The objective of 
      this study was to assess rural community pharmacists' stated willingness to 
      dispense buprenorphine-naloxone, and document potential bias and or stigma that 
      the shopper experiences when asking about buprenorphine- naloxone. METHODS: To 
      assess pharmacist willingness, a telephone audit of 15 rural Appalachian North 
      Carolina pharmacies was conducted. Three secret shopper scenarios were utilized 
      including one shopper posing as a new patient, one shopper posing as an out of 
      state patient, and one shopper first asking about buying syringes. Encounters 
      were noted by willingness to dispense buprenorphine, and shoppers were to note 
      any potential stigma and or bias that they experienced while asking for 
      Suboxone®. RESULTS: Overall, 60% of pharmacies audited indicated willingness to 
      dispense buprenorphine without reservation, and 31% indicated willingness to 
      dispense only under certain circumstances. Pharmacies tended to add more 
      conditions to dispensing to the out of state patient (46%), such as only 
      dispensing if the practitioner was from in state in comparison to the other 
      shopper scenarios. Potential stigma and bias were encountered in 40% of the 45 
      encounters. CONCLUSION: Although pharmacies overall seemed willing to dispense, 
      nuances regarding who pharmacies are most likely to dispense are felt in rural 
      areas. Buprenorphine access limitations were more common in independent 
      pharmacies and more often placed on patients from out of state. Pharmacy- 
      directed education is necessary to reduce stigma and bias and increase patient 
      access to buprenorphine.

AB  - Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a serious, prevalent disorder that affects millions 
      of people. There are numerous evidence-based treatments and strategies to treat 
      AUD, but they are under-utilized for a variety of reasons, including provider 
      stigma, lack of knowledge, lack of professional support, shortage of willing 
      providers, and patient barriers. Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are 
      approved but underused medications for the treatment of AUD. Nonpharmacological 
      strategies and treatments include the use of motivational interviewing when 
      talking to patients about their alcohol use, peer support or mutual help groups, 
      and individualized therapy. Nurses are in a prime position to educate themselves 
      and patients on evidence-based treatments for AUD and to help patients access 
      those treatments. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services,

      Does stigma influence attitudes?

AB  - Researchers have suggested that provider-based stigma of persons who suffer from 
      opioid use disorder (OUD) in the criminal justice system serves as a barrier to 
      fully implementing harm reduction strategies, such as the use of naloxone and 
      medication for addiction treatment (MAT). While scholars have begun to explore 
      the relationships between stigma and first responders' attitudes toward naloxone, 
      little work has been done to assess first responders' attitudes toward other 
      forms of harm reduction, including MAT. The goal of the current exploratory study 
      was to help fill this gap in the literature by assessing first responders' 
      (N = 282) attitudes toward MAT, as well as the correlates of these attitudes. The 
      study specifically focused on examining the relationship between provider-based 
      stigma and attitudes toward MAT. Results show that, in the aggregate, first 
      responders held slightly negative attitudes toward the use of MAT. Moreover, the 
      study found that certain dimensions of stigma (i.e., dangerousness and fatalism) 
      to exhibit a negative relationship with attitudes toward MAT, while support for 
      the disease model of addiction was associated with positive perceptions. Policy 
      implications based on these findings are discussed within.

TI  - Implications of Increased Access to Buprenorphine for Medical Providers in Rural 
      Areas: A Review of the Literature and Future Directions.
PG  - e19870
LID - 10.7759/cureus.19870 [doi]
LID - e19870
AB  - Buprenorphine/Naloxone (Suboxone®) is an efficacious treatment for opioid use 
      disorder (OUD) due to its more convenient dosing, superior safety profile, and 
      decreased incidence of negative side effects when compared to other forms of 
      medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). In the United States, 
      updated legislation in 2021 entitled, "The Practice Guidelines for the 
      Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder", released by 
      the Department of Health and Human Services, creates an exemption for the 
      previously required Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA) waiver for 
      buprenorphine prescribing for clinicians. This legislation was born out of a need 
      for making MOUD more accessible for patients living with OUD as rates of 
      opioid-related deaths in the United States have continued to rise and have 
      increased disproportionately during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      This legislation has the potential to improve access to MOUD across all 
      geographic locations, but may have the most profound impact in rural areas where 
      significant disparities and challenges still exist in patients' ability to access 
      buprenorphine. The purpose of this literature review is to 1) examine how MOUD 
      prescribing has changed after previous legislation changes, 2) explore the 
      current state of buprenorphine access for treatment of OUD in rural America, 3) 
      detail existing barriers in patients' ability to access MOUD, and 4) discuss 
      future directions and considerations as a result of new legislation. This 
      literature review found several existing barriers to receiving MOUD such as 
      increasing costs, insufficient education, significant stigma, and the need for 
      more innovative methods of delivery. We also found that there is currently a 
      large opportunity for growth in the number of rural clinicians able to prescribe 
      buprenorphine, particularly in primary care, that may now occur as a result of 
      this new legislation. Overall, this legislation has the potential to have a 
      positive impact on combating OUD, especially in rural areas, and may be a 
      critical step towards ending the current opioid epidemic in the United States as 
      these described barriers are addressed.

TI  - Community pharmacists in Virginia dispensing naloxone under a standing order: A 
      qualitative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2016, the Virginia Health Commissioner signed a standing order 
      into law allowing licensed pharmacists to dispense opioid receptor antagonists 
      (ORAs) for overdose reversal. OBJECTIVES: Using the theory of planned behavior as 
      an initial guide to study development, the aim of this qualitative study was to 
      explore community pharmacists' attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral 
      control, and behavioral intention toward dispensing ORAs under a standing order 
      in Virginia. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community 
      pharmacists across the Commonwealth between June 2018 and October 2019. 
      Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-one community pharmacists were interviewed. Pharmacists were 
      confused about the specifics and the processes involved with dispensing naloxone 
      under the standing order. Furthermore, many recognized the underuse of the 
      standing order. Positive attitudes focused on the life-saving action of ORAs. 
      Negative attitudes included encouraging risky behaviors by patients, negatively 
      affecting the patient-pharmacist relationship, offending or contributing to 
      stigmatizing patrons, and having liability issues to the pharmacy. Subjective 
      norms regarding dispensing of ORAs under the standing order were perceived to be 
      favorable among peer pharmacists and primary care and emergency department 
      physicians but may be seen as profit-seeking by patients. Barriers to service 
      provision included lack of guidance from corporate offices (in chain pharmacies), 
      inadequate training, patient out-of-pocket costs, reimbursement issues, 
      inadequate staffing and time, and stigma. Facilitators comprised the existence of 
      practice site-specific protocols, the REVIVE! training, technician support, 
      increased community awareness, physician collaboration, pharmacist training, and 
      employer guidance. Whereas some pharmacists intended to become more familiarized 
      with the standing order, others did not intend to actively identify patients who 
      were at risk of an opioid overdose. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists expressed mixed 
      behavioral intention toward dispensing ORAs under the standing order. Future 
      research should focus on quantifying the uptake of the standing order at the 
      state level.

AB  - Police officers have frequent encounters with people who use drugs, either by 
      making an arrest for a drug-related offense or responding to a drug overdose 
      call. Yet, little is known about how police officers view drug addiction - as a 
      disease, a moral failure, or something else - and how their frameworks for 
      conceptualizing addiction impact their attitudes toward drug policies, including 
      the use of naloxone. This research examined police officers' adherence to a 
      moralistic addiction framework in relation to their support for 
      treatment-oriented drug policies. Officers (N = 618) were surveyed about their 
      beliefs on drug policy and the extent to which drug addiction was a product of 
      one's morals or related to social or biological reasons. Results found that 
      approximately 22% of the variance in drug policy attitudes could be explained by 
      addiction frameworks and control variables. Officers who embraced a biological 
      perspective of addiction were more supportive of policies that expanded 
      treatment, including access to naloxone, and less punitive sanctions. Those with 
      stronger moralistic views were less supportive of expanding treatment initiatives 
      and endorsed expanding punitive sanctions. Officer age and education was 
      positively related with expanding treatment and naloxone use while exposure to 
      overdoses was negatively related to policy support. These results demonstrate 
      that officers' frameworks about drug addiction play an important role in drug 
      policy attitudes and, by extension, how they might interact with people who use 
      drugs.

PG  - 982-991
LID - 10.1080/15563650.2021.1893742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the latest medical evidence, Methadone and 
      buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone(®)) are effective treatments for opioid use 
      disorder (OUD). While the evidence basis for the use of these medications is 
      favorable, less is known about the perceptions of the general public about them. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use Twitter to assess the public perceptions about 
      methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone, and to compare their discussion contents 
      based on themes/topics, subthemes, and sentiment. METHODS: We conducted a 
      descriptive analysis of a small and automatic analysis of a large volume of 
      microposts ("tweets") that mentioned "methadone" or "suboxone". In the manual 
      analysis, we categorized the tweets into themes and subthemes, as well as by 
      sentiment and personal experience, and compared the information posted about 
      these two medications. We performed automatic topic modeling and sentiment 
      analysis over large volumes of posts and compared the outputs to those from the 
      manual analyses. RESULTS: We manually analyzed 900 tweets, most of which related 
      to access (15.3% for methadone; 14.3% for buprenorphine-naloxone), stigma (17.0%; 
      15.5%), and OUD treatment (12.8%; 15.6%). Only a small proportion of tweets 
      (16.4% for Suboxone(®) and 9.3% for methadone) expressed positive sentiments 
      about the medications, with few tweets describing personal experiences. Tweets 
      mentioning both medications primarily discussed MOUD broadly, rather than 
      comparing the two medications directly. Automatic topic modeling revealed topics 
      from the larger dataset that corresponded closely to the manually identified 
      themes, but sentiment analysis did not reveal any notable differences in chatter 
      regarding the two medications. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter content about methadone and 
      Suboxone(®) is similar, with the same major themes and similar sub-themes. 
      Despite the proven effectiveness of these medications, there was little dialogue 
      related to their benefits or efficacy in the treatment of OUD. Perceptions of 
      these medications may contribute to their underutilization in combatting OUDs.

TI  - Substance Use Withdrawal and Detox Strategies That Work.
PG  - 12-15
LID - 10.3928/02793695-20210816-02 [doi]
AB  - Substance use disorders are considered chronic but treatable. The first step in 
      recovery is going through withdrawal or detox from the substance used, which 
      typically involves unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms. Some 
      individuals are able and willing to enter inpatient facilities for withdrawal and 
      detox. In some cases, outpatient withdrawal and detox programs are not available. 
      Several barriers to treatment exist, including inability to pay, unavailability 
      of programs, stigma, and co-occurring mental health disorders. During inpatient 
      withdrawal and detox, patients are supported with medications. There is an 
      underutilization of initiating medication that helps reduce substance use, such 
      as naltrexone and suboxone, during inpatient withdrawal and detox. Many 
      individuals opt or have no other choice but to go through withdrawal and detox on 
      their own. Strategies include illicitly obtaining prescription medications for 
      the symptoms and other measures, such as floating in the bathtub and exercise. 
      Recovery from substance use can be facilitated by health care providers through 
      use of harm reduction strategies, referrals to treatment, and prescribing 
      medications when applicable. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health 
      Services, 59(9), 12-15.].

LID - 8515
AB  - Objective. To determine pharmacy students' perspectives regarding opioid use, the 
      opioid crisis, and pharmacy education related to both topics.Methods. Students 
      from each professional year at eight participating schools and colleges of 
      pharmacy were invited to participate in focus groups and answer questions about 
      their experiences with the opioid crisis. Faculty and/or staff moderated the 
      focus groups and audio-recorded responses. Recordings were deidentified, 
      transcribed, and analyzed.Results. One hundred fifty students participated in one 
      of 29 focus groups conducted. Responses were categorized according to themes 
      using consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology. Sources impacting 
      student views on the crisis included school, personal and work experience, and 
      media. Perspective changes since starting school included increased knowledge and 
      awareness and decreased bias/stigma.Conclusion. Conducting focus groups on the 
      opioid crisis provided pharmacy schools with information on what student 
      pharmacists are learning about the crisis, practices they see, and their 
      recommendations to address the crisis. Pharmacy schools can better prepare 
      students to combat the opioid crisis by providing them with training in opioid 
      counseling, use of naloxone, and how to have difficult conversations with 
      patients.

TI  - Facilitators, barriers and lessons learnt from the first state-wide naloxone 
      distribution conducted in West Virginia.
PG  - 369-374
LID - 10.1136/injuryprev-2020-043666 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overdose education and naloxone distribution programmes are known to 
      reduce opioid-related deaths. A state-wide naloxone distribution effort of 8250 
      rescue kits was undertaken by government, community and university partners in 
      West Virginia in 2016-2017. The purpose of this study was to discern the 
      barriers, facilitators and lesson learnt from implementing this endeavour in a 
      rural state with the highest opioid overdose fatality rate in the US. METHODS: 
      Structured interviews (n=26) were conducted among both internal and external 
      stakeholders. Those who participated were >18 years of age and were the lead 
      representative from agencies that either received naloxone (ie, external 
      stakeholders) or helped implement the distribution (ie, internal stakeholders). 
      The interviews followed standardised scripts and lasted approximately 40 min. 
      Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Qualitative content analysis was 
      performed by two researchers to determine themes surrounding facilitators or 
      barriers to programme implementation. RESULTS: The primary facilitators reported 
      by stakeholders included collaborative partnerships, ease of participating in the 
      programme, being established in prevention efforts, demand for naloxone and the 
      need for personal protection from overdose. The primary barriers identified by 
      stakeholders included bureaucracy/policy/procedures of their organisation or 
      agency, stigma, logistical or planning issues, problems with reporting, lack of 
      communication post distribution and sustainability. Numerous lessons were learnt. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the implementation of the programme in 87 organisations, 
      including law enforcement and fire departments, the impact of facilitators 
      outweighed that of barriers. These findings may inform others planning to conduct 
      a similar, large-scale project.

AB  - Background: In 2017, The Respectful and Equitable Access to Comprehensive 
      Healthcare (REACH) Program at Mount Sinai Hospital became a registered Opioid 
      Overdose Prevention Program (OOPP) and received funding from the New York City 
      Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to develop a program to provide overdose 
      education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training to at risk population and 
      bystanders. We report on the programmatic quality improvement initiatives 
      conducted. Methods: From April 2017 to December 2020, the REACH OOPP conducted 
      290 opioid overdose reversal trainings, throughout the Mount Sinai Health System 
      and in multiple other community settings. OEND training was at times offered 
      alone and in other settings alongside Hepatitis C Virus point of care testing. 
      Additionally, a "train the trainer" model was implemented whereby medical 
      students and nurses at outpatient clinics were trained to train others. Results: 
      There were 4235 naloxone kits distributed to 3,906 participants. The training 
      venues included hospital settings (patients and medical staff), public events, 
      substance use programs, educational facilities, homeless prevention programs, 
      faith-based organizations, alternative to incarceration programs, and 
      community-based organizations. We implemented two types of training. During 
      outreach sessions, we utilized one-on-one personalized sessions to train 
      bystanders. When training clinic staff in the "train the trainer" model we 
      utilized a standardized didactic presentation with slides. The two top reasons 
      participants reported for being trained were "Just in case I see someone 
      overdose" (59.3%) and "I'm worried that someone I know will overdose OR that I 
      will overdose" (20.2%). Conclusion: The REACH program at Mount Sinai Hospital 
      developed an effective model to train community bystanders and health care staff 
      by leveraging administrative support and building on broader programmatic 
      initiatives to promote drug user health and stigma-free care for people who use 
      drugs. Hospitals do not currently mandate staff training or keeping naloxone 
      stocked at inpatient units or outpatients clinics posing a challenge when 
      implementing an OEND program in this setting. A recommended policy change needed 
      to decrease overdose deaths is for hospitals to be required to implement 
      systematic naloxone education and access for all health care personal and at risk 
      patients.

      drawing on theories in the morality policy, intergroup relations, addiction, and 
      media communication literatures. A quota sample of 4645 adults (18+ years), 
      randomly drawn from an online research panel and stratified to match age and sex 
      distributions of adults within and across Canadian provinces, was recruited in 
      June 2018. Participants completed survey items assessing support for harm 
      reduction for people who use drugs (PWUD) and for seven harm reduction 
      interventions. Additional items assessed exposure to media coverage on harm 
      reduction, and scales assessing stigma toward PWUD (α = .72), personal 
      familiarity with PWUD (α = .84), and disease model beliefs about addiction (α = 
      .79). Most (64%) Canadians supported harm reduction (provincial estimates = 60% - 
      73%). Five of seven interventions received majority support, including: outreach 
      (79%), naloxone (72%), drug checking (70%), needle distribution (60%) and 
      supervised drug consumption (55%). Low-threshold opioid agonist treatment and 
      safe inhalation interventions received less support (49% and 44%). Our social 
      exposure model, adjusted for respondent sex, household income, political views, 
      and education, exhibited good fit and accounted for 17% of variance in public 
      support for harm reduction. Personal familiarity with PWUD and disease model 
      beliefs about addiction were directly associated with support (βs = .07 and 
      -0.10, respectively), and indirectly influenced public support via stigmatized 
      attitudes toward PWUD (βs = 0.01 and -0.01, respectively). Strategies to increase 
      support for harm reduction could problematize certain disease model beliefs 
      (e.g., "There are only two possibilities for an alcoholic or drug 
      addict-permanent abstinence or death") and creating opportunities to reduce 
      social distance between PWUD, the public, and policy makers.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People who inject drugs may be particularly vulnerable to 
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to 
      underlying health problems, stigma and social vulnerabilities. Harm reduction 
      services, including needle exchange programs (NEP), have been subjected to 
      varying degrees of disruption in the world, especially in the beginning of the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Compared to responses in other 
      countries, Sweden's initial strategy toward limiting the spread and impact of 
      COVID-19 was less restrictive to its citizens with no imposed general societal 
      lockdown. In this study, we investigate changes in drug use patterns, utilization 
      of NEP associated health services, COVID-19 health literacy and the prevalence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among NEP clients in Stockholm during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. METHODS: NEP visits and services provided (needles/syringes, HIV and 
      hepatitis C tests and treatment, naloxone distributed) and overall mortality 
      among NEP clients between January 1 and October 31, 2020, were used for trend 
      analyses in comparison with corresponding 2019 data. Between July 27 and October 
      2, 2020, NEP clients (n = 232) responded to a 27 item COVID-19 Health Literacy 
      Questionnaire. SARS CoV-2 IgG antibody tests (n = 779) were performed between 
      June 15 and October 31, 2020. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic number of 
      clients, client visits, naloxone distribution and HCV tests remained stable 
      compared to 2019, while distribution of needles/syringes increased (p < 0.0001); 
      number of HIV tests and HCV treatments decreased (p < 0.05); and mortality 
      decreased (< 0.01). Overall, the level of health literacy concerning transmission 
      routes and protective measures was high. SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 5.4% 
      (95% CI 4.0-7.2). CONCLUSIONS: The Stockholm NEP managed to maintain a high level 
      of clients and services during the pandemic. In general, COVID-19 health literacy 
      was adequate and the overall SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was low compared to 
      the general population, which highlights a need for prioritized and targeted 
      COVID-19 vaccination among PWID.

TI  - Implementing harm reduction in non-urban communities affected by opioids and 
      polysubstance use: A qualitative study exploring challenges and mitigating 
      strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Harm reduction services, which typically provide overdose education 
      and prevention with distribution of naloxone and other supplies related to safer 
      drug use, help reduce opioid-related overdose and infectious disease 
      transmission. However, structural stigma and the ongoing criminalization of drug 
      use have limited the expansion of harm reduction services into many non-urban 
      communities in the United States that have been increasingly affected by the 
      health consequences of opioid and polysubstance use. METHODS: We conducted 
      qualitative interviews with 22 professionals working with people who use drugs in 
      cities and towns across Rhode Island and Massachusetts to understand challenges 
      and strategies for engaging communities in accepting harm reduction perspectives 
      and services. RESULTS: Our thematic analysis identified several interrelated 
      challenges to implementing harm reduction services in non-urban communities, 
      including: (1) limited understandings of harm reduction practice and preferential 
      focus on substance use treatment and primary prevention, (2) community-level 
      stigma against people who use drugs as well as the agencies supporting them, (3) 
      data reporting and aggregating leading to inaccurate perceptions about local 
      patterns of substance use and related health consequences, and (4) a 
      "prosecutorial mindset" against drug use and harm reduction. From key informants' 
      narratives, we also identified specific strategies that communities could use to 
      address these challenges, including: (1) identifying local champions to advocate 
      for harm reduction strategies, (2) proactively educating communities about harm 
      reduction approaches before they are implemented, (3) improving the visibility of 
      harm reduction services within communities, and (4) obtaining "buy-in" from a 
      wide range of local stakeholders including law enforcement and local government. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings carry important implications for expanding harm 
      reduction services, including syringe service programs and safe injection sites, 
      into non-urban communities that have a demonstrated need for evidence-based 
      interventions to reduce drug-related overdose and infectious disease 
      transmission.

      Toronto.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amid increasing opioid overdose deaths in Canada since 2010 and a 
      changing naloxone access landscape, there is a need for up-to-date research on 
      Canadian women's experiences with opioids. Studies on Canadian take-home naloxone 
      programs are promising, but research beyond these programs is limited. Our study 
      is the first to focus on women's experiences and perspectives on the opioid 
      crisis in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, since the opioid crisis began 
      in 2010. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to address research knowledge gaps 
      involving Canadian women with criminal justice involvement who use opioids, and 
      identify flaws in current policies, responses, and practices. While the opioid 
      overdose crisis persists, this lack of research inhibits our ability to determine 
      whether overdose prevention efforts, especially involving naloxone, are meeting 
      their needs. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews from 
      January to April 2018 with 10 women with experience of opioid use. They were 
      recruited through the study's community partner in Toronto. Participants provided 
      demographic information, experiences with opioids and naloxone, and their 
      perceptions of the Canadian government's responses to the opioid crisis. 
      Interviews were transcribed verbatim and inductive thematic analysis was 
      conducted to determine major themes within the data. RESULTS: Thematic analysis 
      identified seven major concerns despite significant differences in participant 
      life and opioid use experiences. Participants who had used illicit opioids since 
      naloxone became available over-the-counter in 2016 were much more knowledgeable 
      about naloxone than participants who had only used opioids prior to 2016. The 
      portability, dosage form, and effects of naloxone are important considerations 
      for women who use opioids. Social alienation, violence, and isolation affect the 
      wellbeing of women who use opioids. The Canadian government's response to the 
      opioid crisis was perceived as inadequate. Participants demonstrated differing 
      needs and views on ideal harm reduction approaches, despite facing similar 
      structural issues surrounding stigma, addiction management, and housing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced with naloxone use found it to be useful in 
      preventing fatal overdose, however many of their needs with regards to physical, 
      mental, and social health, housing, harm reduction, and access to opioid 
      treatment remained unmet.

TI  - Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) stigma reduces symptoms of morphine-induced 
      dependence and spontaneous withdrawal in rats.
PG  - 170-181
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2020.1865995 [doi]
AB  - Background: Chronic morphine induces physical and psychological dependence signs. 
      Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) stigma has been shown to have anxiolytic, 
      antidepressant, and antinociceptive properties and to alleviate 
      naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs.Objectives: Therefore, this study was 
      designed to examine the effects of saffron aqueous extract on the severity of 
      physical-psychological dependence, voluntary morphine consumption, and the 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serotonin levels following locomotor sensitization in 
      morphine-dependent rats and in rats undergoing morphine withdrawal.Materials: 
      Adult male rats were treated with morphine (10 mg/kg, sc twice daily) for 
      10 days. Rats received saffron extract (60 mg/kg, ip) daily, during the induction 
      of morphine dependence and/or withdrawal. Then, rats were tested for spontaneous 
      withdrawal signs, anxiety using the elevated plus-maze, depression using sucrose 
      preference test, and voluntary morphine consumption using a two-bottle choice 
      paradigm, and then challenged with morphine (1 mg/kg, ip) to evaluate of 
      locomotor sensitization and CSF serotonin levels.Results: The results showed 
      saffron extract during induction of morphine dependence decreased the severity of 
      withdrawal signs (P = .05), while it had no effect on anxiety and depression-like 
      behaviors. Saffron extract during morphine withdrawal exhibited an increase in 
      the percentage (or ratio) of open/total arm entries (P = .017), higher levels of 
      sucrose preference (P = .0001), a lower morphine preference ratio (P = .02) and 
      also, a decrease in locomotor activity (P = .004) and an increase in the CSF 
      serotonin levels (P = .041) in rats challenged to morphine.Conclusions: Saffron 
      extract may exert a protective effect against morphine-induced behavioral 
      sensitization in rats, probably through increasing serotonin levels.

TI  - Prior Authorization for Opioid Use Disorder Versus Pain Medications: Lessons 
      Learned for Parity Enforcement.
PG  - 214-218
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study characterized the use of prior authorization for opioid use 
      disorder medications as compared with that for opioid pain medications in the 
      United States among Medicare Part D plans. METHOD: Medicare Part D formulary data 
      from 2017-2019 were used to describe differences in prior authorization between 
      opioid use disorder medications and opioid pain medications. RESULTS: In 2017, 
      72% of Medicare Part D formularies required prior authorization for brand 
      buprenorphine-naloxone, whereas 6% of formularies required prior authorization 
      for brand oxycodone. In 2019, 3% of formularies required prior authorization for 
      brand buprenorphine-naloxone, whereas 16% of formularies required prior 
      authorization for brand oxycodone. Throughout the study period, other formulary 
      restrictions such as quantity limits were similar for both medications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The disparate use of prior authorization in 2017 for opioid use 
      disorder medications as compared with opioid pain medications suggests that 
      formulary decision making may be inconsistent between medications used to treat 
      substance use disorders and those used to treat pain. If Part D formularies 
      publicly released their decision-making criteria, then there would be a greater 
      understanding of why prior authorization was differentially applied. Greater 
      transparency would help ensure that formulary decisions are not the result of 
      biases and stigma toward substance use disorders.

AB  - Opioid-related morbidity and mortality have risen in many settings globally. It 
      is critical that practitioners who work with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) 
      provide timely, evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Such 
      treatment should include medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including 
      buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. Medication treatment is associated with 
      reduced mortality, fewer relapses to opioid use, and enhanced recovery and 
      retention in addiction care, among other positive health outcomes. Unfortunately, 
      the vast majority of AYAs with OUD do not receive medication. The Society for 
      Adolescent Health and Medicine recommends that AYAs be offered MOUD as a critical 
      component of an integrated treatment approach. Barriers to receipt of medications 
      are widespread; many are common to high-, middle-, and low-income countries 
      alike, whereas others differ. Such barriers should be minimized to ensure 
      equitable access to youth-friendly, affirming, and confidential addiction 
      treatment that includes MOUD. Robust education on OUD and medication treatment 
      should be provided to all practitioners who work with AYAs. Strategies to reduce 
      stigma surrounding medication-and stigma experienced by individuals with 
      substance use disorders more generally-should be widely implemented. A broad 
      research agenda is proposed with the goal of expanding the evidence base for the 
      use and delivery of MOUD for AYAs.

TI  - The substance use intervention team: A hospital-based intervention and outpatient 
      clinic to improve care for patients with substance use disorders.
PG  - 345-353
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxaa408 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In response to the opioid crisis, public health advocates urge hospitals 
      to perform substance use disorder (SUD) screening, brief intervention, discharge 
      planning with referral to treatment, and naloxone education. Universal screening 
      makes specialized treatment available to all patients and decreases stigma around 
      SUDs, allowing patients and providers to address SUDs during their 
      hospitalization. Additionally, hospital and emergency department-initiated 
      medications to treat SUD improve patient engagement with treatment and decrease 
      opioid use, and use of medications for opioid use disorder after nonfatal 
      overdoses decreases mortality. SUMMARY: A substance use intervention team (SUIT) 
      service was established to offer universal screening and consultation by an 
      interdisciplinary team at our urban academic medical center. The SUIT program 
      provides inpatient consultation services as well as medical and behavioral clinic 
      visits to transition patients to long-term treatment and is comprised of 
      physicians, nurse practitioners, a clinical pharmacist, social workers, and a 
      nurse. Successes attributed to enhanced medication use as a function of having a 
      designated pharmacist as an integral member of the team are highlighted. Our 
      medical center initiated screening efforts in tandem with its interdisciplinary 
      team and clinic. The team attempts to start appropriately selected patients with 
      SUD on medications for SUD while hospitalized. From January through December 
      2018, 87.2% of patients admitted to the hospital received initial SUD screening. 
      Of the patients who screened positive, 1,400 received a brief intervention by a 
      unit social worker; the SUIT service was consulted on 880 patients, and multiple 
      medications for SUD were started during inpatient care. CONCLUSION: A screening, 
      brief intervention, and referral to treatment service was successfully 
      implemented in our hospital, with the SUIT program in place to provide 
      interdisciplinary addiction care and initiate medications for SUD in appropriate 
      patients.

TI  - Preparing pharmacists to increase naloxone dispensing within community pharmacies 
      under the Pennsylvania standing order.
PG  - 327-335
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxaa387 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Opioid misuse and overdose deaths remain a public health concern in the 
      United States. Pennsylvania has one of the highest rates of opioid overdose 
      deaths in the country, with Philadelphia County's being 3 times higher than the 
      national average. Despite several multimodal interventions, including use of 
      SBIRT (screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment) methods and 
      naloxone distribution, the rate of overdose deaths remains high. METHODS: To gain 
      insights on strategies for improving access to naloxone and naloxone distribution 
      by pharmacists in Philadelphia County, a study was conducted in 11 community 
      pharmacies (chain and independent) in Philadelphia. Twenty-four pharmacists were 
      recruited and completed SBIRT and naloxone trainings. Each pharmacy elected to 
      have at least 1 pharmacy champion who received additional training on and helped 
      develop pharmacy site-specific naloxone dispensing protocols. RESULTS: Pre-post 
      survey results showed a reduction in stigmatizing attitudes regarding naloxone 
      dispensing and an increase in pharmacists' understanding of the standing order 
      and appropriate naloxone use. There was an increase in pharmacists' self-reported 
      confidence in their ability to appropriately identify, discuss, and dispense 
      naloxone to patients. All pharmacies increased their average monthly dispensing 
      rate following protocol implementation. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists who received both 
      trainings were more likely to change naloxone dispensing practices, leading to an 
      overall increase in naloxone dispensing by community pharmacists. The study 
      addressed overall gaps in pharmacists' knowledge, reduced stigma, and prepared 
      pharmacists to address opioid use and overdose prevention with their patients. 
      The described pharmacist-led patient counseling and intervention service for 
      overdose prevention may be explored as a model for other community pharmacies to 
      adopt to improve naloxone dispensing and similar interventions to reduce overdose 
      deaths.

TI  - What Is Known about Community Pharmacy-Based Take-Home Naloxone Programs and 
      Program Interventions? A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy9010030 [doi]
LID - 30
AB  - A variety of new sources describing community pharmacy-based take-home naloxone 
      (THN) programs have emerged recently in the literature. There is a need to define 
      the types of take-home naloxone programs being offered to support future research 
      designs in implementing and evaluating standardized programs that fill pharmacist 
      and patient knowledge gaps and lift current barriers for optimal community 
      pharmacy naloxone provision. The objective of this paper is to summarize the 
      literature on community pharmacy-based THN programs, including specific program 
      interventions used to increase naloxone dispensing, naloxone availability and 
      dispensing patterns, facilitators and barriers for the THN programs, and 
      knowledge gaps. Online databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and 
      International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) and a search of the grey literature 
      were used to identify eligible sources. Sources were screened by two reviewers 
      for eligibility in COVIDENCE software. Both reviewers compared screening results 
      and resolved conflicts through discussion. A data extraction form for all 
      identified full texts was completed by both reviewers and results were compiled 
      through reviewer discussion. Fifty-two sources met the eligibility criteria. The 
      top three barriers identified were: cost/coverage of naloxone, stigma, and 
      education/training for pharmacists. THN program interventions included screening 
      tools, checklists, pocket cards, patient brochures, and utilizing the pharmacy 
      management system to flag eligible patients. Patient knowledge gaps included 
      naloxone misinformation and lack of awareness, while pharmacists demonstrated 
      administrative, clinical, and counselling knowledge gaps. Naloxone availability 
      was found to be highly variable, where independent and rural pharmacies were less 
      likely to stock or dispense naloxone. Further, pharmacies located in districts 
      with higher rates of opioid overdose deaths and lower household income were also 
      less likely to have naloxone available. This review identified multiple new 
      programs, showcasing that the implementation and evaluation of THN programs are 
      an expanding area of research. Future research should focus on implementing and 
      evaluating a THN program through a randomized controlled trial design that 
      incorporates solutions for the barriers and knowledge gaps identified in this 
      study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate an overdose response training program in public libraries. 
      DESIGN: Mixed methods evaluation including pre- and post-intervention 
      questionnaires and debriefing interviews. SETTING: Ten Philadelphia public 
      libraries. SAMPLE: Overdose response training participants (library staff and 
      community members). INTERVENTION: Public, hour-long overdose response trainings 
      run by the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, the Free Library of 
      Philadelphia, and the University of Pennsylvania between March and December 2018. 
      MEASURES: Questionnaires assessed motivation for attending trainings, overdose 
      response readiness, and intention to acquire and carry naloxone. Debriefing 
      interviews elicited training feedback. ANALYSIS: We assessed changes in overdose 
      response readiness and intention to carry naloxone and performed thematic 
      analysis on interview data. RESULTS: At 29 trainings, 254 people attended, of 
      whom 203 (80%) completed questionnaires and 23 were interviewed. 30% of 
      participants had witnessed an overdose, but only 3% carried naloxone at baseline. 
      Following training, overdose response readiness and intention to acquire/carry 
      naloxone improved significantly (P < .01). Interviewees nonetheless noted that 
      they experienced barriers to naloxone acquisition, including cost, stigma, and 
      concern regarding future insurability. Trainings subsequently included naloxone 
      distribution. Interviewees reported that public libraries were welcoming, 
      nonstigmatizing venues. CONCLUSION: In Philadelphia, library-based overdose 
      response trainings were well-attended and reached a population with prior 
      overdose encounters. Similar trainings could be deployed as a scalable overdose 
      prevention strategy in the nation's 16 568 public libraries.

TI  - Intervention Stigma toward Medications for Opioid Use Disorder: A Systematic 
      Review.
PG  - 2181-2201
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2021.1975749 [doi]
AB  - Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are evidence-based treatments, yet can 
      be controversial among some populations. This study provides a systematic review 
      of prejudice and discrimination toward MOUD, a form of "intervention stigma," or 
      stigma associated with a particular medical treatment. A systematic search 
      strategy was used in PsychInfo and PubMed to identify studies published between 
      1998 and 2018. Studies that empirically examined stigma toward MOUD were included 
      if the manuscript was of moderate or high quality. Studies were analyzed using 
      thematic synthesis. The search yielded 972 studies, of which 28 were included. 
      Most studies utilized qualitative methods to examine intervention stigma toward 
      methadone or buprenorphine, with one including naltrexone. Studies demonstrated 
      that intervention stigma among healthcare providers was influenced by lack of 
      training and abstinent treatment preferences. Providers equated MOUD with illicit 
      substance use and at times refused to care for MOUD patients. Stigma among peer 
      patients seeking treatment was also influenced by abstinent treatment 
      preferences, and among the general public stigma was influenced by lack of MOUD 
      knowledge. Intervention stigma was also driven at the policy level by high 
      regulation of methadone, which fueled diversion and hindered social functioning 
      among patients. Few studies indicated how to reduce intervention stigma toward 
      MOUD. Intervention stigma affects both provision and perceptions of methadone and 
      buprenorphine, decreasing access and utilization of MOUD. Future research should 
      further develop and test MOUD stigma reduction interventions in a variety of 
      social contexts to improve access to care and reduce patient barriers.

LID - 10.1080/10826084.2021.1958866 [doi]
AB  - Physicians trained in opioid use disorder (OUD) harm reduction can mitigate 
      opioid overdose deaths by prescribing naloxone and educating patients about its 
      use. Unfortunately, many physicians possess OUD stigma. Training during medical 
      school presents an opportunity to reduce OUD stigma and improve opioid overdose 
      reversal knowledge. This study assessed the efficacy of Opioid Overdose Awareness 
      and Reversal Training (OOART) and evaluated the equivalency of the online and 
      in-person OOART. Methods: Voluntary training was delivered to first-year medical 
      (M1) students at one medical school. In 2018 and 2019, 29 and 68 M1 students, 
      respectively, received in-person OOART training and completed pre- and 
      post-training surveys. In 2020, 62 students participated in online OOART 
      training, of which 53 completed both pre- and post-training surveys. Results: All 
      three opioid overdose Knowledge questions showed significant improvements between 
      pre- and post-training survey responses. For Attitude questions, six of eleven 
      questions in 2019 and 2020 and four of eleven questions in 2018 had statistically 
      significant improvements between pre- and post-training survey responses. There 
      were no statistical differences between in-person and online post-training survey 
      results for two out of the three Knowledge questions and all 11 Attitude 
      questions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that our OOART was effective in 
      increasing opioid overdose reversal knowledge and reducing OUD stigma. There was 
      no meaningful difference in outcomes between the training modalities. These 
      results support the future expansion of online and in-person OOART to a larger 
      population of medical students.

AB  - Although medication-assisted treatment (MAT) effectively treats opioid use 
      disorders (OUD), MAT access is restricted in criminal justice (CJ) settings. 
      Previous studies have documented that stigma and limited knowledge about MAT are 
      prevalent among CJ court personnel. We describe development and pilot testing of 
      an eLearning intervention to improve MAT knowledge and increase MAT referrals in 
      Ohio courts. Methods: Building upon a nationwide survey conducted in 2011 of drug 
      courts and informed by MAT opinions from judges who supervised OUD clients, we 
      developed two eLearning MAT modules. Judges completed a brief online MAT 
      knowledge-attitude scale (K-A) before, after, and at 3 months. Judges were asked 
      about MAT referrals pretest and 3 months later. Results: Sixty-three judges 
      expressed interest in the study, 25 completed the pretest and viewed the modules, 
      11 completed a 3 month posttest. At pretest, K-A scores were significantly 
      (p<.05) lower for agonist medications than for extended-release naltrexone 
      (XR-NTX; Vivitrol). K-A scores improved at posttest for agonist medications 
      (p<.05) but declined to pretest levels three months later. Three months after the 
      pretest, buprenorphine referrals increased from 2.6% to 9.7% (p<.05). There was 
      no significant difference on K-A scores for agonist medication between the Ohio 
      sample (at pretest) and the 2011 sample. Conclusion: Although there is some 
      indication that eLearning may have strengthened knowledge gains and increased 
      buprenorphine referrals, a more robust eLearning intervention will likely be 
      required to increase court personnel participation and sustain eLearning 
      knowledge gains. Recruiting and sustaining judges' participation in the study 
      represented a significant study limitation.

TI  - Patient perspectives of barriers to naloxone obtainment and use in a primary 
      care, underserved setting: A qualitative study.
PG  - 1030-1039
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2021.1915915 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gaps in naloxone obtainment and use are not well studied, 
      particularly among minoritized groups. Objective: To describe patient 
      perspectives that serve as barriers to naloxone obtainment and the number of 
      patients who obtained naloxone in a primarily African American population in a 
      primary care, underserved setting. Methods: This qualitative study conducted 
      semi-structured interviews and included 36 adults who were prescribed naloxone at 
      a federally qualified health center using convenience sampling. Participants 
      answered survey questions describing naloxone acceptability, perceived risk for 
      overdose, and barriers to naloxone use. Results: Sixty-nine percent of the 
      patients were Black or African American. The majority of patients attempted to 
      fill their naloxone at a local pharmacy (69%) and reported no difficulties (88%). 
      Five major themes revealed: overall positive views of naloxone because it saves 
      lives; existing knowledge gaps related to indications for naloxone prescription; 
      stigma surrounding receiving a naloxone prescription; inadequacies of the patient 
      education provided; and the role providers play in naloxone receptivity 
      Conclusions: Among a majority African American population, many perceived 
      naloxone to be lifesaving. However, stigmatizing perceptions and inability to 
      recall patient education contribute to a perception of low overdose risk. Further 
      research describing the impact of the opioid epidemic on underrepresented groups 
      is necessary.

TI  - Perceptions diverge on aspects related to substance use disorder: An analysis of 
      individuals in recovery, physicians, nurses, and medical students.
PG  - 896-904
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2021.1892014 [doi]
AB  - Background: Interactions with healthcare workers can provide effective entrance 
      into treatment, ensuring retention and lifelong recovery for individuals with 
      Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Healthcare providers approach the challenges of 
      patient management with different skills, comfort levels, and viewpoints. 
      Individuals in recovery also provide crucial perspectives relevant to the complex 
      aspects of the drug epidemic. The purpose of this study was to determine if 
      perceptions of SUD diverge among individuals in recovery, physicians, nurses and 
      medical students. Methods: A survey consisting of 29 Likert statements was 
      deployed to physicians, nurses, medical students, and persons with SUD in 
      recovery. Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement on statements 
      about SUD such as treatment, stigma, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), 
      naloxone kits, safe injection sites, and methamphetamine usage. Separate Welch's 
      analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were conducted to determine differences between 
      the respondent groups and each statement. For any statistically significant 
      findings, Games-Howell post-hoc analyses were employed. Results: A total of 523 
      individuals provided survey responses: individuals in recovery (n = 111), 
      physicians (n = 113), nurses (n = 206), and medical students (n = 93). Survey 
      results revealed the majority of items had statistically significant differences 
      in respondent groups. Perceptions diverged on items related to treatment, stigma, 
      MOUD, take-home naloxone kits, safe injection sites, needle exchange programs, 
      and methamphetamine. Conclusion: As healthcare providers and policymakers develop 
      treatment strategies to engage those with SUD in quality treatment, they will 
      benefit from understanding how different viewpoints on SUD affect treatment for 
      these individuals. These attitudes impact stigma, willingness to prescribe new 
      treatments, and development of clinical relationships. The insight from this 
      study allows for important discussions on the substance use health crisis and 
      further inquiry on why these differences exist and how the diverging viewpoints 
      may impact the lives of persons with SUD.

TI  - Challenges and Facilitators of Implementing a Physician-approved Naloxone 
      Protocol: A Mixed-methods Study.
PG  - 40-48
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000672 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2015, the State of Ohio passed legislation to allow pharmacists to 
      dispense naloxone under a physician-approved protocol. The legislation allows all 
      individuals authorized under a physician-approved protocol to personally furnish 
      naloxone without requiring clients to be seen by a licensed prescriber, thus 
      expanding the capacity of Ohio's community distribution programs. We aimed to 
      evaluate the implementation of legislation allowing for a physician-approved 
      protocol in pharmacies and other naloxone distribution sites in Ohio, and to 
      compare barriers and facilitators of implementing the law changes among sites 
      that implemented a physician-approved protocol versus sites that did not. 
      METHODS: The study used a convergent parallel mixed-method design. Random samples 
      from all pharmacies registered with the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy and 
      community naloxone distribution sites were selected. Quantitative data were 
      collected via survey (n = 168) and qualitative data were collected via 
      semi-structured interviews (n = 17). RESULTS: Most survey respondents agreed that 
      the policy has expanded access to naloxone at their site for individuals who want 
      or need the medication. Both pharmacies and other naloxone distribution sites 
      identified that leadership and organizational support facilitated protocol 
      implementation and cost, stigma, and lack of naloxone demand challenged protocol 
      implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified barriers and facilitators to 
      the implementation of a physician-approved protocol within Ohio. The majority of 
      respondents stated they could implement a protocol. However, barriers of cost, 
      lack of public awareness of naloxone availability, and stigma remain for 
      pharmacies and other naloxone distribution sites.

AB  - Stigma is a known barrier to treating substance use disorders and dramatically 
      diminishes the quality of life of people who use drugs (PWUD) nonmedically. 
      Stigma against PWUD may be especially pronounced in rural areas due to their 
      decreased anonymity and residents' limited access, or resistance, to 
      "neutralizing" information on factors associated with drug use. Stigma often 
      manifests in the attitudes of professionals whom stigmatized individuals 
      regularly interact with and often materially impact. We analyzed interviews 
      conducted between July 2018 and February 2019 with professional stakeholders in 
      rural southern Illinois who interact with PWUD, specifically those who use 
      opioids nonmedically or who inject drugs (n = 30). We further analyzed interview 
      data from a complementary PWUD sample (n = 22). Interviews addressed perspectives 
      around nonmedical drug use and treatment/harm reduction, with analysis centered 
      around the Framework Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma and its focus on 
      micro, meso and macro level stigmatization processes. Stakeholder participants 
      included professionals from local law enforcement, courts, healthcare 
      organizations, emergency management services, and faith-based and social services 
      organizations. Most stakeholders, particularly law enforcement, negatively 
      perceived PWUD and nonmedical drug use in general, questioned the character, 
      agency and extrinsic value of PWUD, and used labels (e.g. "addict," "abuser," 
      etc.) that may be regarded as stigmatizing. Further, most respondents, including 
      PWUD, characterized their communities as largely unaware or dismissive of the 
      bio-medical and sociocultural explanations for opioid use, drug injection and 
      towards harm reduction services (e.g., syringe exchanges) and naloxone, which 
      were frequently framed as undeserved usages of taxpayer funds. In conclusion, 
      rural stigma against PWUD manifested and was framed as a substantial issue, 
      notably activating at micro, meso and macro levels. Stigma prevention efforts in 
      these communities should aim to improve public knowledge on the intricate factors 
      contributing to opioid use and drug injection and harm reduction programming's 
      moral and fiscal value.

TI  - Incoming medical students' knowledge of and attitudes toward people with 
      substance use disorders: Implications for curricular training.
PG  - 692-698
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2020.1843104 [doi]
AB  - Background: Medical students may be in an ideal position to identify patients 
      with substance use disorders (SUDs) and provide them with information about harm 
      reduction and treatment options. Specific education regarding opioid use disorder 
      (OUD) and naloxone during undergraduate medical training may help students 
      identify these patients and decrease their own negative attitudes toward patients 
      with OUD. To plan for curriculum development, this study aimed to understand 
      baseline knowledge and attitudes among students entering medical school. Methods: 
      During orientation, all first-year medical students (Class of 2023) were asked to 
      complete a survey that explored their previous experiences in healthcare and with 
      SUDs as well as their attitudes toward opioid overdose and patients with SUDs. We 
      administered the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS), Opioid Overdose 
      Attitudes Scale (OOAS), Medical Conditions Regard Scale (MCRS), and Naloxone 
      Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B). Results: 266 students (89.6% of the 
      class) completed the survey. Generally, these students were relatively proficient 
      in opioid overdose knowledge, but did not feel they were competent enough to 
      respond to an overdose. Attitudes toward patients with SUDs were mixed. 
      Approximately half of the students thought naloxone distribution should be 
      unrestricted, but many were uncertain whether naloxone receipt would deter 
      individuals from seeking treatment or increase opioid use. Students' previous 
      experiences in healthcare (e.g., employment) results in significantly different 
      knowledge and attitudes toward opioid overdose response. Conclusions: These 
      incoming medical students have greater healthcare experience and level of opioid 
      overdose knowledge than the general population, but still harbor significant 
      misinformation and stigma toward patients with SUDs. These findings provide a 
      foundation upon which to tailor didactic efforts, starting early in medical 
      school, so that graduating physicians can be adequately prepared for clinical 
      care.

TI  - Assessing perceptions about medications for opioid use disorder and Naloxone on 
      Twitter.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1080/10550887.2020.1811456 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Qualitative analysis of Twitter posts reveals key insights about 
      user norms, informedness, perceptions, and experiences related to opioid use 
      disorder (OUD). This paper characterizes Twitter message content pertaining to 
      medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and Naloxone.Methods: In-depth 
      thematic analysis was conducted of 1,010 Twitter messages collected in June 2019. 
      Our primary aim was to identify user perceptions and experiences related to harm 
      reduction (e.g., Naloxone) and MOUD (e.g., sublingual and Extended-release 
      buprenorphine, Extended-release naltrexone, Methadone).Results: Tweets relating 
      to OUD were most commonly authored by general Twitter users (43.8%), private 
      residential or detoxification programs (24.6%), healthcare providers (e.g., 
      physicians, first responders; 4.3%), PWUOs (4.7%) and their caregivers (2.9%). 
      Naloxone was mentioned in 23.8% of posts and authored most commonly by general 
      users (52.9%), public health experts (7.4%), and nonprofit/advocacy organizations 
      (6.6%). Sentiment was mostly positive about Naloxone (73.6%). Commonly mentioned 
      MOUDs in our search consisted of Buprenorphine-naloxone (13.8%), Methadone 
      (5.7%), Extended-release naltrexone (4.1%), and Extended-release buprenorphine 
      (0.01%). Tweets authored by PWUOs (4.7%) most commonly related to factors 
      influencing access to MOUD or adverse events related to MOUD (70.8%), negative or 
      positive experiences with illicit substance use (25%), policies related to 
      expanding access to treatments for OUD (8.3%), and stigma experienced by 
      healthcare providers (8.3%).Conclusion: Twitter is utilized by a diverse array of 
      individuals, including PWUOs, and offers an innovative approach to evaluate 
      experiences and themes related to illicit opioid use, MOUD, and harm reduction.

TI  - Community Attitudes Toward Opioid Use Disorder and Medication for Opioid Use 
      Disorder in a Rural Appalachian County.
PG  - 29-34
LID - 10.1111/jrh.12503 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate community attitudes concerning opioid use disorder (OUD) and 
      medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in a rural community, and to plan 
      educational initiatives to reduce stigma surrounding OUD and treatment. METHODS: 
      Dissemination of a 24-question survey to people living in a rural community 
      followed by comparative analysis of survey results between 2 groups classified by 
      recognition of OUD as a real illness. FINDINGS: Three hundred sixty-one 
      individuals responded. Overall, 69% agreed that OUD is a real illness. 
      Respondents recognizing OUD as a real illness were less likely to agree that 
      individuals with OUD are dangerous (P = .014), more likely to agree that MOUD is 
      effective (P < .001), that individuals with OUD should have the same right to a 
      job (P < .001), and that naloxone should be administered for every overdose every 
      time (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Significant stigma exists toward individuals with 
      OUD in rural communities, and recognizing OUD as a real illness is associated 
      with less stigmatizing attitudes and better understanding of MOUD. Further study 
      should focus on how to effectively convince communities that OUD is a real 
      illness.

TI  - Reasons People Who Use Opioids Do Not Accept or Carry No-Cost Naloxone: 
      Qualitative Interview Study.
PG  - e22411
LID - 10.2196/22411 [doi]
LID - e22411
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many people use opioids and are at risk of overdose. Naloxone is an 
      opioid antagonist used to counter the effects of opioid overdose. There is an 
      increased availability of naloxone in New York City; however, many who use 
      opioids decline no-cost naloxone even when offered. Others may have the 
      medication but opt not to carry it and report that they would be reluctant to 
      administer it if they were to witness an overdose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to better 
      understand why people who use opioids may be reluctant to accept, carry, and 
      administer naloxone, and to inform the development of messaging content that 
      addresses barriers to its acceptance and use. METHODS: We conducted formative 
      qualitative interviews with 20 people who use opioids who are 18 years and older 
      in New York City. Participants were recruited via key informants and chain 
      referral. RESULTS: Participants cited 4 main barriers that may impede rates of 
      naloxone acceptance, possession, and use: (1) stigma related to substance use, 
      (2) indifference toward overdose, (3) fear of negative consequences of carrying 
      naloxone, and (4) fear of misrecognizing the need for naloxone. Participants also 
      offered suggestions about messaging content to tackle the identified barriers, 
      including messages designed to normalize naloxone possession and use, encourage 
      shared responsibility for community health, and elicit empathy for people who use 
      drugs. Taken together, participants' narratives hold implications for the 
      following potential messaging content: (1) naloxone is short-acting, and 
      withdrawal sickness does not have to be long-lasting; (2) it is critical to 
      accurately identify an opioid-involved overdose; (3) anyone can overdose; (4) 
      naloxone cannot do harm; and (5) the prompt administration of the medication can 
      help ensure that someone can enjoy another day. Finally, participants suggested 
      that messaging should also debunk myths and stereotypes about people who use 
      drugs more generally; people who use opioids who reverse overdoses should be 
      framed as lay public health advocates and not just "others" to be managed with 
      stigmatizing practices and language. CONCLUSIONS: It must be made a public health 
      priority to get naloxone to people who use opioids who are best positioned to 
      reverse an overdose, and to increase the likelihood that they will carry naloxone 
      and use it when needed. Developing, tailoring, and deploying messages to address 
      stigma, indifference toward overdose, fear and trepidation about reversing an 
      overdose, and fear of police involvement may help alleviate fears among some 
      people who are reluctant to obtain naloxone and use the medication on someone in 
      an overdose situation.

TI  - The HEALing (Helping to End Addiction Long-term (SM)) Communities Study: Protocol 
      for a cluster randomized trial at the community level to reduce opioid overdose 
      deaths through implementation of an integrated set of evidence-based practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose deaths remain high in the U.S. Despite having 
      effective interventions to prevent overdose deaths, there are numerous barriers 
      that impede their adoption. The primary aim of the HEALing Communities Study 
      (HCS) is to determine the impact of an intervention consisting of 
      community-engaged, data-driven selection, and implementation of an integrated set 
      of evidence-based practices (EBPs) on reducing opioid overdose deaths. METHODS: 
      The HCS is a four year multi-site, parallel-group, cluster randomized wait-list 
      controlled trial. Communities (n = 67) in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York and 
      Ohio are randomized to active intervention (Wave 1), which starts the 
      intervention in Year 1 or the wait-list control (Wave 2), which starts the 
      intervention in Year 3. The HCS will test a conceptually driven framework to 
      assist communities in selecting and adopting EBPs with three components: 1) a 
      community engagement strategy with local coalitions to guide and implement the 
      intervention; 2) a compendium of EBPs coupled with technical assistance; and 3) a 
      series of communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and 
      reduce stigma. An implementation science framework guides the intervention and 
      allows for examination of the multilevel contexts that promote or impede adoption 
      and expansion of EBPs. The primary outcome, number of opioid overdose deaths, 
      will be compared between Wave 1 and Wave 2 communities during Year 2 of the 
      intervention for Wave 1. Numerous secondary outcomes will be examined. 
      DISCUSSION: The HCS is the largest community-based implementation study in the 
      field of addiction with an ambitious goal of significantly reducing fatal opioid 
      overdoses.

TI  - Health communication campaigns to drive demand for evidence-based practices and 
      reduce stigma in the HEALing communities study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The HEALing Communities Study (HCS) is testing whether the 
      Communities that Heal (CTH) intervention can decrease opioid overdose deaths 
      through the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in highly impacted 
      communities. One of the CTH intervention components is a series of communications 
      campaigns to promote the implementation of EBPs, increase demand for naloxone and 
      medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and decrease stigma toward people 
      with opioid use disorder and the use of EBPs, especially MOUD. This paper 
      describes the approach to developing and executing these campaigns. METHODS: The 
      HCS communication campaigns are developed and implemented through a collaboration 
      between communication experts, research site staff, and community coalitions 
      using a three-stage process. The Prepare phase identifies priority groups to 
      receive campaign messages, develops content for those messages, and identifies a 
      "call to action" that asks people to engage in a specific behavior. In the Plan 
      phase, campaign resources are produced, and community coalitions develop plans to 
      distribute campaign materials. During the Implement stage, these distribution 
      plans guide delivery of content to priority groups. Fidelity measures assess how 
      community coalitions follow their distribution plan as well as barriers and 
      facilitators to implementation. An evaluation of the communication campaigns is 
      planned. CONCLUSIONS: If successful, the Prepare-Plan-Implement process, and the 
      campaign materials, could be adapted and used by other communities to address the 
      opioid crisis. The campaign evaluation will extend the evidence base for how 
      communication campaigns can be developed and implemented through a 
      community-engaged process to effectively address public health crises.

TI  - Barriers and Facilitators to the Use of Medications for Opioid Use Disorder: a 
      Rapid Review.
PG  - 954-963
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-06257-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that medications to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) 
      are effective, most people who could benefit from this treatment do not receive 
      it. This rapid review synthesizes evidence on current barriers and facilitators 
      to buprenorphine/naloxone and naltrexone at the patient, provider, and system 
      levels to inform future interventions aimed at expanding treatment. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched numerous bibliographic databases through May 2020 and 
      selected studies published since 2014. Study selection, data abstraction, coding 
      of barriers and facilitators, and quality assessment were first completed by one 
      reviewer and checked by a second. RESULTS: We included 40 studies of 
      buprenorphine (5 also discussed naltrexone). Four types of patient and 
      provider-level barriers to OUD medication use emerged-stigma related to OUD 
      medications, treatment experiences and beliefs (positive or negative), logistical 
      issues (time and costs as well as insurance and regulatory requirements), and 
      knowledge (high or low) of OUD and the role of medications. Stigma was the most 
      common barrier among patients, while logistical issues were the most common 
      barriers among providers. Facilitators for both patients and providers included 
      peer supports. Most administrator-identified or system-level barriers and 
      facilitators fit into the category of logistical issues. We have moderate 
      confidence in buprenorphine findings but low confidence in naltrexone findings 
      due to the small number of studies. DISCUSSION: Stigma, treatment experiences, 
      logistical issues, and knowledge gaps are the main barriers associated with low 
      utilization of OUD medications. These barriers can overlap and mutually reinforce 
      each other, but given that, it is plausible that reducing one barrier may lead to 
      reductions in others. The highest priority for future research is to evaluate 
      interventions to reduce stigma. Other priorities for future research include 
      better identification of barriers and facilitators for specific populations, such 
      as those with OUD related to prescription opioids, and for naltrexone use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. Medications for opioid 
      use disorder (MOUD) include: 1) buprenorphine, 2) methadone, and 3) 
      extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Research should investigate patients' and 
      providers' perspectives of MOUD since they can influence prescription, retention, 
      and recovery. METHODS: This systematic review focused on patients' and providers' 
      perceptions of MOUD. The review eligibility criteria included inclusion of the 
      outcome of interest, in English, and involving persons ≥18 years. A PubMed 
      database search yielded 1692 results; we included 152 articles in the final 
      review. RESULTS: There were 63 articles about buprenorphine, 115 articles about 
      methadone, and 16 about naltrexone. Misinformation and stigma associated with 
      MOUD were common patient themes. Providers reported lack of training and 
      resources as barriers to MOUD. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that patients 
      have significant misinformation regarding MOUD. Due to the severity of the opioid 
      epidemic, research must consider the effects of patients' and providers' 
      perspectives on treatment for OUD, including the effects on the type of MOUD 
      prescribed, patient retention and adherence, and ultimately the number of 
      patients treated for OUD, which will aid in curbing the opioid epidemic.

TI  - Pharmacy Students' Perceptions and Stigma Surrounding Naloxone Use in Patients 
      with Opioid Use Disorder: A Mixed Methods Evaluation.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy8040205 [doi]
LID - 205
AB  - Pharmacists represent a key group of healthcare professionals that can increase 
      awareness and destigmatize naloxone use. The objective of this study was to 
      investigate pharmacy student perceptions of the use, dispensing, and stigma 
      surrounding naloxone. An electronic survey was administered to pharmacy students 
      that included questions about demographics, work history, naloxone use, and 
      naloxone stigma. Separate qualitative interviews were performed to identify 
      themes surrounding naloxone use. Two-hundred sixty-two participants completed the 
      survey. The majority of participants were "highly willing" (74%) to fill a 
      naloxone prescription for a patient and "somewhat comfortable" (38%) in 
      counseling on naloxone; most were "somewhat comfortable" (38%) administering 
      naloxone. Naloxone is "very rarely" (87%) recommended in community workplace 
      settings, and the majority (64%) reported that patients never request information 
      about naloxone availability. Seventy-six percent of respondents reported that 
      naloxone-associated interactions have an influence on the way they communicate 
      with patients in community pharmacy settings. Thematic analyses found that 
      pharmacy students identify the importance of naloxone as a life-saving medication 
      and the need for naloxone training, but patient-perceived stigma and limited 
      access to naloxone remain prevalent. Pharmacy students are generally well-versed 
      and inclined toward distributing, counseling on, and administering naloxone. 
      Naloxone is rarely dispensed and patient conversations involving naloxone are 
      infrequent in community settings. Future efforts focused on approaches toward 
      difficult patient conversations and normalization of naloxone are needed to 
      destigmatize and facilitate use.

      Infectious Disease Encounters: Narrative Review.

AB  - Increased rates of overdose (OD) and blood-borne infections have been associated 
      with injection drug use (IDU). This increasing overlap between IDU-related 
      infectious diseases (ID) is a byproduct of the opioid OD crisis, especially with 
      the transition to synthetic opioids with faster onset and shorter duration 
      leading to potentially more frequent injections. ID specialists are uniquely 
      positioned to positively impact the opioid OD crisis by capitalizing on 
      opportunistic moments of engagement during clinical encounters with people who 
      inject drugs (PWID). Harm reduction services should therefore be expanded and 
      offered to PWID in ID settings to reduce rates of OD, infection, and 
      hospitalization. Major target areas include (1) teaching and distribution of 
      materials related to safer injection practice such as sterile injection supplies, 
      fentanyl test strips, and naloxone; (2) increased screening and access to 
      pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis; and (3) initiation of 
      medications for opioid use disorder. Incorporating these strategies in various 
      treatment settings can expand treatment access, improve patient outcomes, and 
      reduce stigma associated with IDU.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more 
      than 47,600 deaths as a result of opioid overdose in the United States. In an 
      effort to reduce these deaths, California passed legislation providing 
      pharmacists with the ability to furnish naloxone without a prescription. Our 
      study examined pharmacies in San Francisco that furnished naloxone and provided 
      guidance for pharmacies seeking to develop similar programs. The study aims were 
      to (1) identify the legal, structural, social-environmental, and financial 
      components of a pharmacy model that allows for successful naloxone distribution, 
      (2) evaluate the attitudes and beliefs of pharmacy staff members toward patients 
      receiving or requesting naloxone, and (3) assess relationships between these 
      attitudes and beliefs and naloxone furnishing at the pharmacy. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study used a series of semistructured interviews of pharmacy 
      staff in San Francisco conducted April-October 2019. Through a thematic, 
      inductive analysis of collected data, emerging themes were mapped to the primary 
      study aims. RESULTS: We interviewed 14 pharmacists and pharmacy technicians at 4 
      community pharmacies. We identified 4 factors for success in implementing a 
      naloxone furnishing protocol: administrative-led efforts, pharmacist-led efforts, 
      increasing pharmacist engagement, and increasing patient engagement. The 
      respondents also discussed the approaches they used to overcome previously 
      identified barriers: cost, time, expectations of unwanted clientele, and 
      patients' feelings of stigma. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists' approaches to implementing 
      naloxone furnishing had common features across locations, suggesting many of 
      these strategies could be replicated in other community pharmacies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Naloxone is an antidote to opioid overdose, and community pharmacies 
      nationwide now provide broad access to this medication. OBJECTIVE: The aim of 
      this qualitative study was to understand how leaders in pharmacy organizations 
      perceive pharmacies and pharmacy staff can optimize dispensing of naloxone. 
      METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 pharmacy leaders in 
      Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Participants were recruited from three types of 
      community pharmacies: (1) chain; (2) independent; and (3) hospital outpatient. 
      Theory-driven immersion crystallization, using Brownlee et al.'s model of 
      healthcare quality improvement, was used to inform coding of the interview data, 
      with predetermined categories of staff; organization; and process. RESULTS: Five 
      main themes were identified: (1) Importance of staff training to increase 
      comfort; (2) Strength through coordination of efforts; (3) Pharmacy as a 
      community leader in the opioid crisis; (4) Persisting stigma; and (5) Ongoing 
      workflow challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The results uniquely reflect the experiences 
      and insights of pharmacy leaders implementing public health initiatives during 
      the opioid crisis and can be used for gaining insight into how pharmacists can 
      efficiently provide naloxone to their communities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emergency department encounters are an opportunity to distribute 
      naloxone kits to patients at risk of opioid overdose. Several programs cite mixed 
      uptake and implementation barriers including staff education and burden. 
      Emergency nurses can facilitate many approaches to naloxone distribution (eg, 
      prescription, overdose education, dispensing take-home naloxone). To evaluate 
      acceptance, we investigated nurse perceptions about take-home naloxone, 
      describing potential barriers to program implementation. METHODS: This 
      qualitative study enrolled 17 emergency nurses from an urban trauma center 
      emergency department and affiliated community emergency department. During the 
      study period, nurses in both sites could distribute take-home naloxone kits 
      stocked in the medication dispensing system. We conducted 12 individual, in-depth 
      interviews and 3 distinct focus groups involving 12 nurses in aggregate. A 
      semistructured interview guide was used with a range of topics surrounding pain 
      management, addiction, opioid overdose, and emergency care. We employed 
      conventional content analysis to enable thematic analysis of transcripts. 
      RESULTS: Six component themes emerged as part of the overarching theme "mixed 
      feelings about naloxone-morally distressing." One positive theme identified 
      naloxone as an opportunity for discussion. Negative themes included (1) Addiction 
      is a choice, why can't we help other diseases? It's unfair; (2) Providing 
      naloxone enables and condones the behavior; (3) Emergency departments cannot 
      treat social issues; (4) Patients can't give it to themselves; it's wasting 
      money; and (5) Moral distress. DISCUSSION: Perceptions and moral distress may be 
      a barrier to ED-based take-home naloxone programs. Development of interventions 
      targeting naloxone misperceptions and addiction stigma should be a goal of 
      expanded implementation efforts.

TI  - Revisiting pharmacy-based naloxone with pharmacists and naloxone consumers in 2

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pharmacies provide accessible sources of naloxone to caregivers, 
      patients taking opioids, and individuals using drugs. While laws permit expanded 
      pharmacy naloxone access, prior work identified barriers like concerns about 
      stigma of addiction and time constraints that inhibit scale-up. We sought to 
      examine similarities and differences in experiences obtaining naloxone at the 
      pharmacy over a 1-year period in 2 states, and to explore reactions from people 
      with opioid use disorder, patients taking opioids for chronic pain, caregivers of 
      opioid users, and pharmacists to communication tools and patient outreach 
      materials designed to improve naloxone uptake. DESIGN: Eight focus groups (FGs) 
      held December 2016 to April 2017 in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from pharmacies, health clinics, and 
      community organizations; pharmacists were recruited from professional 
      organizations and pharmacy colleges. OUTCOME MEASURES: The FGs were led by 
      trained qualitative researchers using a topic guide and prototypes designed for 
      input. Five analysts applied a coding scheme to transcripts. Thematic analysis 
      involved synthesis of coded data and connections between themes, with comparisons 
      across groups and to first-year findings. RESULTS: A total of 56 individuals 
      participated: patients taking opioids for chronic pain (n = 13), people with 
      opioid use disorders (n = 15), caregivers (n = 13), and pharmacists (n = 16). 
      Fear of future consequences and stigma in the pharmacy was a prominent theme from 
      the previous year. Four new themes emerged: experience providing pharmacy 
      naloxone, clinician-pharmacist-partnered approaches, naloxone coprescription, and 
      fentanyl as motivator for pharmacy naloxone. Prototypes for prompting consumers 
      about naloxone availability, materials facilitating naloxone conversations, and 
      posters designed to address stigma were well received. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences 
      dispensing naloxone are quickly evolving, and a greater diversity of patients are 
      obtaining pharmacy naloxone. Persistent stigma-related concerns underscore the 
      need for tools to help pharmacists offer naloxone, facilitate patient requests, 
      and provide reassurance when getting naloxone.

TI  - Providers' perceptions on barriers and facilitators to prescribing naloxone for 
      patients at risk for opioid overdose after implementation of a national academic 
      detailing program: A qualitative assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Academic detailing is an educational outreach program that aligns 
      providers' prescribing with evidence-based practice. The U.S. Department of 
      Veterans Affairs (VA) Opioid Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) 
      Program partnered with the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management National Academic 
      Detailing Service to deliver naloxone education to providers who cared for 
      patients at risk of opioid overdose. In this pilot study, we interviewed 
      providers' who received academic detailing to capture their perceptions of 
      facilitators and barriers to prescribing naloxone. OBJECTIVE: To identify 
      providers' perceptions of facilitators and barriers to prescribing naloxone for 
      patients at risk for opioid overdose after implementation of a national academic 
      detailing program. METHODS: This was a hybrid inductive-deductive qualitative 
      pilot using semi-structured interviews with VA providers to explore constructs 
      associated with facilitators and barriers to prescribing take-home naloxone to 
      patients at risk for opioid overdose from August 2017 to April 2018. RESULTS: 
      Eleven participants were interviewed, six physicians, three clinical psychiatric 
      pharmacists, and two nurse practitioners. Participants identified patient-level 
      barriers (social stigma and lack of homeless patient support), poor data 
      integration, and burden of data validation as barriers to prescribing naloxone. 
      However, they also identified patient lists, repeat visits, and 
      face-to-face/one-on-one video conferencing visits as important facilitators for 
      naloxone prescribing. CONCLUSIONS/IMPORTANCE: Academic detailing will need to 
      address issues of social stigma regarding naloxone, educate providers about 
      existing support systems for homeless veterans, and develop tools for data 
      integration to improve naloxone access for veterans at risk for an opioid 
      overdose.

AB  - The Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) Overdose Prevention Task Force 
      (OPTF) was created with a vision to reduce overdose deaths around the country 
      through osteopathic medical student action and advocacy. With the medical 
      understanding that opioid overdose is a public health crisis and that there are 
      knowledge deficits within patient populations subject to possible overdose and 
      use disorders, our aim is to increase medical education and training within the 
      medical community, starting at the medical student level. Our focus at this time 
      is to create training and distribution programs for naloxone, to advocate for 
      effective Good Samaritan Laws in states where they are lacking, and to increase 
      access to medication-assisted treatments (MAT) in the communities that need them 
      most. Foundational to the mission of the OPTF is education of the general public 
      and medical communities on harm reduction practices and reducing the stigma 
      surrounding substance use. Student leaders are strategically dispersed nationally 
      over 40 campuses to achieve these goals.

TI  - Comparing Reasons for Starting and Stopping Methadone, Buprenorphine, and 
      Naltrexone Treatment Among a Sample of White Individuals With Opioid Use 
      Disorder.
PG  - e44-e52
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000584 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite their efficacy, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) 
      are underutilized in the United States. Nonetheless, few studies have explored 
      reasons why individuals choose to start MOUD or discontinue MOUD after starting, 
      especially extended-release naltrexone. We sought to identify reasons why 
      individuals start and stop MOUD, including the differences between starting and 
      stopping the 3 most common formulations: methadone, sublingual buprenorphine, and 
      extended-release naltrexone. METHODS: We conducted 31 semistructured interviews 
      over the phone with a sample of white individuals with a history of MOUD 
      utilization. Participants were recruited using snowball sampling from 8 US 
      states. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded in Dedoose software, 
      and analyzed using thematic analysis and modified event structure analysis. 
      RESULTS: Participants primarily learned about methadone and buprenorphine from 
      other individuals with OUD. Participants primarily became interested in starting 
      buprenorphine and methadone after seeing the medications work effectively in 
      peers, though methadone was perceived as a last resort. In contrast, participants 
      primarily learned about and became interested in naltrexone after receiving 
      information from health practitioners. Participants frequently stopped MOUD to 
      prevent medication or health service dependence. Participants also felt stigma 
      and external pressure to stop buprenorphine and methadone, but not naltrexone. 
      Some participants identified relapse and medication termination by health 
      providers or the criminal justice system as reasons for stopping MOUD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the frequency with which participants identified informal peer 
      education as a reason for starting methadone and buprenorphine, peers with MOUD 
      experience may be a trusted source of information for individuals seeking OUD 
      treatment. Further research is needed to assess whether incorporating peer 
      support specialists with MOUD experience into formal SUD treatment would expand 
      MOUD utilization, retain patients in treatment, and/or improve OUD treatment 
      outcomes.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 across health services, including treatment services for 
      people who use drugs, is emerging but likely to have a high impact. Treatment 
      services for people who use drugs provide essential treatment services including 
      opiate agonist treatment and needle syringe programmes alongside other important 
      treatment programmes across all substance types including withdrawal and 
      counselling services. Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians 
      support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in 
      efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health 
      problems.COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness. 
      Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods. Ensuring ongoing 
      supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes 
      to how treatment is provided. The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as 
      moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on 
      sublingual buprenorphine and methadone. Ensuring ready access to take-home 
      naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks. Delivery of methadone 
      and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is 
      likely to need to occur to support home isolation.People who use drugs are likely 
      to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy 
      and stigma and discrimination towards this group. People who use drugs may 
      prioritise drug use above other health concerns. Adequate supply of clean 
      injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses. 
      Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage 
      this by using opioids. Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug 
      treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is 
      indicated is important.

TI  - Supporting individuals using medications for opioid use disorder in recovery 
      residences: challenges and opportunities for addressing the opioid epidemic.
PG  - 266-272
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2020.1719410 [doi]
AB  - Full and partial opioid agonists and opioid antagonist medications play an 
      important role in containing the opioid epidemic. However, these medications have 
      not been used to their full extent. Recovery support services, such as recovery 
      residences (RRs), also play a key role. RRs may increase an individual's recovery 
      capital, facilitate social support for abstinence, and foster a sense of 
      community among residents. These processes may be critical for individuals with 
      opioid use disorder (OUD). In combination these two recovery pathways have the 
      potential to enhance one another and improve outcomes among residents with OUD. 
      Barriers to doing so have resulted in a limited supply of residences that can 
      support residents using opioid agonist and antagonist medications. This 
      perspective describes key interpersonal and structural barriers to medication use 
      among individuals with an OUD seeking support from a recovery residence and 
      discusses measures for reducing these barriers. These measures include workforce 
      development to address stigma and attitudinal barriers and enhancing residence 
      capability to ensure resident safety and reduce potential diversion. The 
      perspective also highlights the need for additional research to facilitate the 
      identification of best practices to improve outcomes among residents treated with 
      medications living in recovery residences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the use and public perception of naloxone through 
      distribution and education by pharmacists at local health screenings in 
      low-income communities in Western Pennsylvania. METHODS: A prospective study was 
      conducted, offering education on opioid use disorder and naloxone to individuals 
      attending community outreach events in Allegheny County, PA. Participants with 
      interest and willingness to use naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose were 
      offered naloxone nasal spray and additional training. These individuals were 
      asked to complete a survey at the time of naloxone provision and were recontacted 
      by telephone at a later date to collect follow-up data. The primary objective of 
      the study was to ascertain naloxone use at follow-up. Secondary objectives of the 
      study were to measure the difficulty of obtaining naloxone, identify any change 
      in knowledge of naloxone before and after pharmacist intervention, and assess 
      public perception of stigma associated with naloxone initiatives. Data were 
      analyzed using descriptive and univariate comparative statistics. RESULTS: A 
      total of 265 people received naloxone, and 132 (49.8%) completed the initial 
      survey. Fifty-seven participants subsequently completed both surveys (43.2% 
      follow-up). Naloxone was utilized by 3.5% of respondents over an average of 3 
      months. Participants' perception of obtaining naloxone before the study was 
      evenly distributed (35.8% never tried, 32.1% difficult, and 30.2% not difficult). 
      A total of 52.6% of respondents believed that naloxone initiatives decreased the 
      stigma of illicit opioid use. CONCLUSION: Naloxone provided in the community 
      setting was utilized by a small percentage of the general public in the 2- to 
      4-month follow-up. Pharmacists can provide naloxone education and training within 
      communities affected by high opioid overdose rates.

TI  - Integrating naloxone education into an undergraduate nursing course: Developing 
      partnerships with a local department of health.
PG  - 439-445
LID - 10.1111/phn.12707 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance misuse continues to be a significant concern in the United 
      States, with over 700,000 lives lost from a drug overdose between 1999 and 2017. 
      However, nursing curricula have failed to keep pace with the epidemic. METHODS: 
      The current study used a pre-post study design and involved a convenience sample 
      of undergraduate nursing students (n = 37) enrolled in a community health nursing 
      course. Students completed an 11-item online survey examining naloxone stigma, 
      naloxone self-efficacy, and naloxone knowledge. A paired sample t test was 
      conducted to evaluate the impact of the in-person training and education event. 
      RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in post-intervention 
      naloxone knowledge scores from the pre-survey (M = 3.57, SD = 0.959) to the 
      post-survey (M = 4.70, SD = 0.520). Stigma toward naloxone demonstrated a 
      statistically significant increase in the post-intervention stigma survey 
      (M = 9.00, SD = 1.312) compared with the pre-intervention stigma survey 
      (M = 7.78, SD = 2.228). Naloxone self-efficacy also demonstrated a statistically 
      significant increase in the post-intervention naloxone efficacy survey 
      (M = 10.08, SD = 1.064) compared with the pre-intervention naloxone efficacy 
      scores (M = 7.38, SD = 2.22). CONCLUSIONS: The students' scores demonstrated a 
      significant increase in naloxone knowledge, self-efficacy, and stigma. Future 
      research is needed to explore the impact of integrating naloxone education in the 
      undergraduate nursing curriculum.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to assess how a naloxone counseling experience 
      impacted student pharmacists' confidence in counseling patients on naloxone use 
      and their attitudes towards people who use drugs. METHODS: Students who completed 
      a naloxone counseling experience at a syringe exchange program were recruited to 
      conduct individual interviews. Investigators asked student participants 
      open-ended questions to identify their perceptions in the following domains: 
      experiences with naloxone, reported impact of naloxone counseling experience on 
      confidence, experiences with people who use drugs, value of the experience, and 
      suggestions for improvement for the experience. RESULTS: Fifteen student 
      pharmacists participated in semi-structured interviews. Fourteen of these 
      students reported the experience as extremely valuable in developing their 
      confidence with naloxone. The average change in confidence was 5.2 points on a 1 
      through 10 scale, and seven of the student pharmacists independently suggested 
      that a naloxone counseling experience be incorporated the required doctor of 
      pharmacy curriculum. The qualitative themes that emerged from student feedback 
      were breaking down the stigma of addiction and feeling useful during this 
      experience. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a naloxone counseling experience at a 
      syringe exchange program was perceived as helpful in improving student pharmacist 
      confidence in counseling patients on naloxone use. Incorporation of required 
      experiential learning about naloxone and people who use drugs may positively 
      impact student pharmacists by giving them more confidence and experience with 
      this underserved population.

TI  - An ethical analysis of medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for 
      persons who are incarcerated.
PG  - 150-154

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly prevalent among persons who are incarcerated. 
      Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD), methadone, buprenorphine, 
      and naltrexone, is widely used to treat OUD in the community. Despite MOUD's 
      well-documented effectiveness in improving health and social outcomes, its use in 
      American jails and prisons is limited.Several factors are used to justify limited 
      access to MOUD in jails and prisons including: "uncertainty" of MOUD's 
      effectiveness during incarceration, security concerns, risk of overdose from 
      MOUD, lack of resources and institutional infrastructure, and the inability of 
      people with OUD to provide informed consent. Stigma regarding MOUD also likely 
      plays a role. While these factors are relevant to the creation and implementation 
      of addiction treatment policies in incarcerated settings, their ethicality 
      remains underexplored.Using ethical principles of beneficence/non-maleficence, 
      justice, and autonomy, in addition to public health ethics, we evaluate the 
      ethicality of the above list of factors. There is a two-fold ethical imperative 
      to provide MOUD in jails and prisons. Firstly, persons who are incarcerated have 
      the right to evidence-based medical care for OUD. Secondly, because jails and 
      prisons are government institutions, they have an obligation to provide that 
      evidence-based treatment. Additionally, jails and prisons must address the 
      systematic barriers that prevent them from fulfilling that responsibility. 
      According to widely accepted ethical principles, strong evidence supporting the 
      health benefits of MOUD cannot be subordinated to stigma or inaccurate 
      assessments of security, cost, and feasibility. We conclude that making MOUD 
      inaccessible in jails and prisons is ethically impermissible.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition, often associated 
      with legal, interpersonal, and employment problems. Medications demonstrated to 
      be effective for OUD are methadone (a full opioid agonist), buprenorphine (a 
      partial agonist), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Methadone and 
      buprenorphine act by suppressing opioid withdrawal symptoms and attenuating the 
      effects of other opioids. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid agonists. Oral 
      methadone has the strongest evidence for effectiveness. Longer duration of 
      treatment allows restoration of social connections and is associated with better 
      outcomes. Treatments for OUD may be limited by poor adherence to treatment 
      recommendations and by high rates of relapse and increased risk of overdose after 
      leaving treatment. Treatment with methadone and buprenorphine has the additional 
      risk of diversion and misuse of medication. New depot and implant formulations of 
      buprenorphine and naltrexone have been developed to address issues of safety and 
      problems of poor treatment adherence. For people with OUD who do not respond to 
      these treatments, there is accumulating evidence for supervised injectable opioid 
      treatment (prescribing pharmaceutical heroin). Another medication mode of 
      minimizing risk of overdose is take-home naloxone. Naloxone is an opioid 
      antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose, and take-home naloxone programs aim 
      to prevent fatal overdose. All medication-assisted treatment is limited by lack 
      of access and by stigma. In seeking to stem the rising toll from OUD, expanding 
      access to approved treatment such as methadone, for which there remains the best 
      evidence of efficacy, may be the most useful approach.

TI  - Concerns that an opioid antidote could "make things worse": Profiles of risk 
      compensation beliefs using the Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs 
      (NaRRC-B) scale.
PG  - 245-251
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2019.1616348 [doi]
AB  - Background and aims: As opioid overdose death rates reach epidemic proportions in 
      the United States, the widespread distribution of naloxone is imperative to save 
      lives. However, concerns that people who use drugs will engage in riskier drug 
      behaviors if they have access to naloxone remain prevalent, and the measurement 
      scales to assess these risk compensation concerns remain under researched. This 
      study aims to examine the validity of the Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation 
      Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scale and to understand the effect of overdose education and 
      naloxone distribution (OEND) training on risk compensation beliefs across 
      demographic and professional populations. Methods: A total of 1424 participants, 
      803 police officers, 137 emergency medical services (EMS)/fire personnel, and 484 
      clinical treatment and social service providers were administered surveys before 
      and after attending an OEND training. Survey items measured the endorsement of 
      opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes, as well as risk compensation beliefs. 
      Results: Police and EMS/fire personnel expressed greater endorsement of risk 
      compensation beliefs than clinical treatment and social service providers at both 
      pre- and post-OEND training. Although endorsement of risk compensation beliefs 
      was significantly reduced in each of the 3 groups after the training, reductions 
      were greatest among EMS/fire personnel, followed by providers, then police. 
      Moreover, younger, male, and black participants endorsed greater beliefs in risk 
      compensatory behaviors as compared with their older, female, and white 
      counterparts. Conclusion: This study validated a novel measure of 
      naloxone-related risk compensation beliefs and suggests participating in OEND 
      trainings decreases beliefs in naloxone-related risk compensation behaviors. OEND 
      trainings should consider addressing concerns about naloxone "enabling" drug use, 
      particularly in law enforcement settings, to continue to reduce stigma 
      surrounding naloxone availability.

TI  - Very Low Frequency of Drug Therapy of Alcohol Dependence in Germany - Analysis of 
      Data of A Statutory Health Insurance.
PG  - 37-39
LID - 10.1055/a-0896-2757 [doi]
AB  - Acamprosate and naltrexone are medications of proven efficacy in the treatment of 
      alcohol dependence. In order to investigate the prescription of these drugs in 
      outpatient routine treatment in Germany (frequency of prescription, duration, 
      medical specialty of prescribing physician), data of a large statutory health 
      insurance were analyzed. Persons were included who were discharged from inpatient 
      treatment with an alcohol-related disorder among their diagnoses during a one 
      year observation period and with no diagnosed additional substance-related 
      disorder (apart from nicotine- and cannabis-related disorders). Thus 12.958 
      patients were identified (mainly male, 77.9%; at average 51.4 years [+/-12.7] of 
      age). 44.3% of these patients were treated in a psychiatric hospital, the 
      remaining patients in hospitals of other specialties (e. g. 9.2% in departments 
      of surgery). During an observation period of 6 months after discharge, 
      acamprosate or naltrexone were prescribed at least once to 98 persons (0.76% of 
      12.958 patients; acamprosate n=80, 0.62%; naltrexone n=18, 0.14%). 16 (0.12%) 
      patients were prescribed acamprosate or naltrexone for more than 3 months. Half 
      of the prescriptions were issued by general practitioners. Possible reasons for 
      this under-prescription are lack of knowledge about the drug treatment of alcohol 
      dependence outside of addiction psychiatry, neglect of biological aspects 
      (including medication) regarding etiology and treatment of substance-related 
      disorders, and stigma of patients with substance-related disorders.

BTI - Administration of Naloxone in a Home or Community Setting: A Rapid Qualitative 
      Review
AB  - Canada is in the midst of an opioid crisis. The number of deaths due to opioids 
      has increased from 3,023 in 2016 to 4,588 in 2018. In 2018, this equated to the 
      life of one Canadian being lost every 2 hours as a result of opioid use. The 
      increase in opioid-related deaths has been attributed to a number of different 
      causes. The increased contamination of street drugs due to fentanyl is one 
      reason, with estimates of the percent of opioid deaths due to fentanyl or 
      fentanyl analogues having increased from 50% in 2016 to 79% in 2019. Prescription 
      opioids have also contributed to the crisis. The volume of opioids sold to 
      Canadian hospitals and pharmacies has increased by more than 3000% since the 
      early 1980’s, with over 20 million prescriptions dispensed for opioids in 2016 
      alone. Addressing the opioid crisis has been complicated by the fact that the use 
      of opioids is illegal in Canada, unless prescribed by a physician. Therefore, 
      many opioid users buy opiates illegally on the street, and these opiates have 
      unknown strength and may be contaminated with other drugs such as fentanyl. In 
      addition, those who face addictions are frequently greeted with stigma, rather 
      than an understanding of their addiction and mental health problems. To help 
      address these issues, a Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act was enacted so that 
      those who call for help when an overdose occurs are protected from drug 
      possession charges. The distribution of naloxone kits in the community is one 
      strategy being implemented internationally to reduce the number of opioid-related 
      deaths. Naloxone is a powerful anti-opioid drug, which temporarily blocks the 
      effect of the opioid on the body. Furthermore, it is not harmful for those who 
      have not been exposed to opioids. In Canada, take-home naloxone kits are 
      available at most pharmacies without a prescription and are free in some 
      provinces.(,) The naloxone kits include naloxone nasal spray or naloxone 
      intramuscular injection. Both take less than five minutes to take effect. For 
      these reasons, the distribution of naloxone kits in the community has been a 
      powerful tool to save the lives of those who have experienced an overdose due to 
      opioid use, and there has been increased efforts to expand the availability of 
      naloxone in the community setting. This purpose of this report was to explore the 
      experience of administering naloxone in the home and community setting and to 
      explore whether this experience differs between those who may typically 
      administer naloxone, including paramedics and peers or people who use drugs 
      (PWUD). Understanding the administration of naloxone from the perspective of the 
      person administering it is useful for a number of different reasons. It can 
      highlight the challenges and advantages of using naloxone from the perspective of 
      the user, and can shed light on the emotional consequences of dealing with the 
      opioid crisis.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to recruitment and enrollment of HIV-infected 
      individuals with opioid use disorder in a clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The CTN-0067 CHOICES trial tests implementation of extended-release 
      naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) for opioid use disorders 
      (OUD) in HIV clinics to improve HIV viral suppression. The study team 
      investigated recruitment strategies to elucidate the barriers and facilitators to 
      recruitment and enrollment in the study. MAIN TEXT: Methods: Semi-structured, 
      in-depth, digitally recorded interviews were completed with study 
      recruitment-related staff and medical providers (n = 26) from six participating 
      HIV clinics in the fall of 2018. Interviews probed 1) factors that might prevent 
      prospective participants from engaging in study recruitment and enrollment 
      procedures and 2) strategies used by study staff that encourage eligible patient 
      participation. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed using a 
      content analysis approach. RESULTS: All respondents reported that barriers to 
      recruitment and enrollment included challenging patient social and structural 
      factors (e.g., homelessness or living environments with high substance use, 
      criminal justice involvement), difficulty locating patients with unsuppressed HIV 
      viral load and OUD within the HIV clinic, time-consuming study enrollment 
      processes, and stigma around HIV and OUD which inhibited treatment seeking. Some 
      respondents observed that distrust of research and researchers impeded 
      recruitment activities in the community. A specific medication-related barrier 
      was patient fear of opioid abstinence required prior to XR-NTX induction. 
      Facilitators of recruitment included use of trusted peer outreach/recruitment 
      workers in the community, hospitalizations that offered windows of opportunities 
      for screening and XR-NTX induction, providing participant transportation, and 
      partnerships with harm reduction organizations for referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Though 
      study personnel encountered barriers to recruitment in the CHOICES study, persons 
      with untreated HIV and OUD can be enrolled in multisite clinical trials by using 
      enhanced recruitment strategies that extend outside of the HIV clinic. Employing 
      peer outreach workers and collaborating with syringe service programs may be 
      especially helpful in facilitating recruitment and merit inclusion in similar 
      study protocols.

AB  - THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES: Parse's theory of humanbecoming describes shame as a 
      sense that one is failing to conform to both personal and societal expectations 
      of high value. Shame and stigma, negative perceptions others hold of an 
      individual based on failure to conform to societal expectations, that surround 
      opioid use disorders are linked to patients not seeking medical treatment due to 
      the social isolation and humiliation brought on by the disease. PHENOMENON 
      ADDRESSED: This article reviews the resistance of some health care providers to 
      discuss the realities of substance abuse with adolescent patients and their 
      families, and identifies how the stigma that some health care providers place on 
      opioid use disorders makes them less likely to discuss and prescribe naloxone, 
      the reversal agent for opioids. When families are prepared to prevent overdose 
      deaths by administering naloxone, lives can be saved, and time can be preserved 
      for developing long-term treatment options. RESEARCH LINKAGES: Research should 
      develop curricula that teach how to identify unconscious bias that may exist on 
      the part of the healthcare provider, and to understand the negative effects of 
      stigmatizing opioid use. Bedside nurses and practitioners should be equipped to 
      educate patients and their families about naloxone and its availability, and to 
      explain that it is a safe and effective way to prevent opioid related deaths. 
      When presented in a nonjudgmental way, information about naloxone is a critical 
      component in addressing the opioid epidemic, preventing deaths and providing time 
      for further treatment options.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Take-home naloxone (THN) possession among people who inject drugs 
      (PWID) in rural communities is understudied. Better understanding the nature of 
      THN possession among rural PWID could inform the implementation of overdose 
      prevention initiatives. The purpose of this research is to determine factors 
      associated with rural PWID having recently received THN. METHODS: Data from a 
      PWID population estimation study implemented in Cabell County, West Virginia were 
      used for this research. Multivariable Poisson regression with a robust variance 
      estimator was used to evaluate the independent effects of several measures (e.g., 
      sociodemographics, structural vulnerabilities, substance use) on PWID having 
      received THN in the past 6 months. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of our sample 
      (n = 371) of PWID reported having received THN in the past 6 months. Factors 
      associated with having received THN were: age (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 
      [aPR] = 1.02; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.01-1.03), having recently accessed 
      sterile syringes at a needle exchange program (aPR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.35-2.46), 
      believing that doctors judge people who use drugs (aPR = 1.50; 95% CI: 
      1.07-2.12), and having witnessed at least one non-fatal overdose in the past 6 
      months (aPR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.06-1.94). Greater numbers of overdose events in the 
      past 6 months were also associated with having received THN. CONCLUSIONS: Among 
      rural PWID in West Virginia, slightly less than half received THN in the past 6 
      months. Rural communities need overdose prevention interventions that are 
      responsive to the unique needs of rural PWID, decrease stigma, and ensure PWID 
      have access to harm reduction services and drug treatment programs.

AB  - In 2013, Vermont leaders implemented the "hub-and-spoke" (H & S) system to 
      increase access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD). "Hubs" 
      are licensed specialty opioid treatment programs (OTPs) with the authority to 
      dispense buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone. "Spokes" are primary care 
      practices that provide office-based opioid treatment, primarily with 
      buprenorphine/naloxone. This report describes the qualitative component of an 
      evaluation of the H&S system, conducted in 2016. The qualitative data collection 
      assessed patient perspectives about the positive and negative aspects of 
      treatment in the H & S system. The data collected included 80 responses to five 
      open-ended questions and 24 in-depth interviews. Five open-ended questions were 
      completed with hub (n = 40) and spoke (n = 40) participants. In-depth qualitative 
      interviews were conducted with different hub (n =12) and spoke (n =12) 
      participants. Findings from both data collection approaches suggest positive 
      perceptions about treatment overall by patients treated in both settings. 
      Participants treated in spokes reported a positive treatment environment, minimal 
      stigma, and few obstacles to treatment and a strong positive relationship with 
      their prescriber. Hub patients valued the MOUD and expressed gratitude for having 
      access to MOUD, but reported the treatment environment was somewhat challenging, 
      with long lines and drug talk in the clinic, high staff turnover and "cookie 
      cutter" treatment. There appear to be some differences in patient perceptions of 
      MOUD treatment between patients treated in primary care settings and specialized 
      OTP settings.

AB  - Opioid use disorders (OUDs) are diseases of the brain with behavioral, 
      psychological, neurobiological, and medical manifestations. Vulnerability to OUDs 
      can be affected by factors such as genetic background, environment, stress, and 
      prolonged exposure to μ-opioid agonists for analgesia. Two standard-of-care 
      maintenance medications, methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone, have a long-term 
      positive influence on health of persons with opioid addiction. Buprenorphine and 
      another medication, naltrexone, have also been approved for administration as 
      monthly depot injections. However, neither medication is used as widely as 
      needed, due largely to stigma, insufficient medical education or training, 
      inadequate resources, and inadequate access to treatment. Ongoing directions in 
      the field include (i) personalized approaches leveraging genetic factors for 
      prediction of OUD vulnerability and prognosis, or for targeted pharmacotherapy, 
      and (ii) development of novel analgesic medicines with new neurobiological 
      targets with reduced abuse potential, reduced toxicity, and improved 
      effectiveness, especially for chronic pain states other than cancer pain.

TI  - Perceptions of extended-release naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine 
      treatments following release from jail.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have documented patient attitudes and experiences with 
      extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) opioid relapse prevention in criminal 
      justice settings. This study assessed barriers and facilitators of 
      jail-to-community reentry among adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) treated 
      with XR-NTX, buprenorphine, methadone, and no medications. METHODS: This 
      qualitative study conducted individual interviews with a purposeful and 
      convenience sample of adults with OUD who were recently released from NYC jails. 
      XR-NTX, no medication, and methadone participants were concurrently enrolled in a 
      large randomized controlled trial evaluating XR-NTX vs. a no medication Enhanced 
      Treatment As Usual (ETAU) condition, or enrolled in a non-randomized 
      quasi-experimental methadone maintenance cohort. Buprenorphine participants were 
      referred from NYC jails to a public hospital office-based buprenorphine program 
      and not enrolled in the parent trial. Interviews were audio recorded, 
      transcribed, independently coded by two researchers, and analyzed per a grounded 
      theory approach adapted to the Social Cognitive Theory framework. The research 
      team reviewed transcripts and coding to reach consensus on emergent themes. 
      RESULTS: N = 33 adults with OUD (28 male, 5 female) completed a single individual 
      interview. Purposeful sampling recruited persons leaving jail on XR-NTX (n = 11), 
      no active medication treatment (n = 9), methadone (n = 9), and buprenorphine 
      (n = 4). Emergent themes were: (1) general satisfaction with XR-NTX's long-acting 
      antagonist effects and control of cravings; (2) "testing" XR-NTX's blockade with 
      heroin upon reentry was common; (3) early discontinuation of XR-NTX treatment was 
      most common among persons with high self-efficacy and/or heavy exposure to drug 
      use environments and peers; (4) similar satisfaction regarding effects of 
      methadone and buprenorphine maintenance among retained-in-treatment individuals, 
      alongside general dissatisfaction with daily observed dosing requirements and 
      misinformation and stigmas regarding methadone adverse effects; (5) unstable 
      housing, economic insecurity, and exposure to actively using peers were 
      attributed to early termination of treatment and relapse; (6) individual 
      motivation and willpower as central to long-term opioid abstinence and reentry 
      success. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of more familiar agonist maintenance 
      treatments, XR-NTX relapse prevention during jail-to-community reentry was viewed 
      as a helpful and unique intervention though with important limitations. Commonly 
      described barriers to treatment retention and heroin abstinence included 
      homelessness, economic insecurity, and drug-using peers. Trial registration

AB  - AIM: To test the effects of drug court participation on long-term mortality risk. 
      METHODS: During 1997-98, 235 individuals charged with a non-violent offense were 
      randomly assigned to Baltimore City Drug Treatment Court (BCDTC) or traditional 
      adjudication. Heroin was the predominant substance of choice among the sample. 
      Participant mortality was observed for 15 years following randomization. RESULTS: 
      Over 20% of participants died during the study, at an average age of 46.6 years, 
      and 64.4% of deaths were substance-use related. Survival analyses estimated that 
      neither mortality from any cause nor from substance use-related causes 
      significantly differed between BCDTC and traditional adjudication. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Frequent and premature death among the sample indicates that this is a high-risk 
      population in need of effective substance use treatment. Roughly half of drug 
      treatment courts are now estimated to offer medication assisted treatment (MAT), 
      which is currently the most effective treatment for opioid use disorders. In this 
      study of BCDTC implemented over 15 years ago, only 7% of participants received 
      MAT, which may explain the lack of program impact on mortality. Historical 
      barriers to providing MAT in drug court settings include access, concerns about 
      diversion, negative attitudes, blanket prohibitions, and stigma. Drug treatment 
      courts should implement best practice standards for substance use treatment and 
      overdose prevention, including increased access to MAT and naloxone, and training 
      to reduce stigmatizing language and practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to understand the implementation of multifaceted community 
      plans to address opioid-related harms. DESIGN: Our scoping review examined the 
      extent of the literature on community plans to prevent and reduce opioid-related 
      harms, characterise the key components, and identify gaps. DATA SOURCES: We 
      searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINHAL, SocINDEX and Academic Search Primer, 
      and three search engines for English language peer-reviewed and grey literature 
      from the past 10 years. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible records addressed 
      opioid-related harms or overdose, used two or more intervention approaches (eg, 
      prevention, treatment, harm reduction, enforcement and justice), involved two or 
      more partners and occurred in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
      Development country. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Qualitative thematic and 
      quantitative analysis was conducted on the charted data. Stakeholders were 
      engaged through fourteen interviews, three focus groups and one workshop. 
      RESULTS: We identified 108 records that described 100 community plans in Canada 
      and the USA; four had been evaluated. Most plans were provincially or state 
      funded, led by public health and involved an average of seven partners. Commonly, 
      plans used individual training to implement interventions. Actions focused on 
      treatment and harm reduction, largely to increase access to addiction services 
      and naloxone. Among specific groups, people in conflict with the law were 
      addressed most frequently. Community plans typically engaged the public through 
      in-person forums. Stakeholders identified three key implications to our findings: 
      addressing equity and stigma-related barriers towards people with lived 
      experience of substance use; improving data collection to facilitate evaluation; 
      and enhancing community partnerships by involving people with lived experience of 
      substance use. CONCLUSION: Current understanding of the implementation and 
      context of community opioid-related plans demonstrates a need for evaluation to 
      advance the evidence base. Partnership with people who have lived experience of 
      substance use is underdeveloped and may strengthen responsive public health 
      decision making.

TI  - Dispensing Naloxone Without a Prescription: Survey Evaluation of Ohio 
      Pharmacists.
PG  - 412-421
LID - 10.1177/0897190018759225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports a 200% 
      escalation in the rate of opioid overdose deaths in the United States. 
      Unfortunately, Ohio has been deemed the epicenter of the nation's opioid 
      epidemic. In 2015, Ohio passed a bill that permits a pharmacist to distribute 
      naloxone without a prescription. OBJECTIVES: This survey was aimed to discover 
      pharmacists' knowledge of naloxone and Ohio law, perceived barriers that may 
      prohibit naloxone dispensing, and Ohio pharmacists' general confidence, comfort, 
      perception, and experience dispensing naloxone per physician protocol. METHODS: 
      Pharmacists' knowledge of naloxone and Ohio law pertaining to dispensing 
      naloxone; perceived barriers to naloxone distribution; and overall experience, 
      willingness, comfort, and perceptions of personally supplying naloxone were 
      assessed using multiple-choice and Likert-type scale questions through an e-mail 
      survey. RESULTS: Overall, Ohio pharmacists were knowledgeable about naloxone and 
      displayed confidence in their training and ability to provide patient education 
      on naloxone. Pharmacists were less certain about Ohio law pertaining to naloxone 
      distribution, especially those who have been in practice longer. Pharmacists 
      indicated several barriers to dispensing naloxone and the need for more training. 
      Younger pharmacists were more likely to report a concern with clientele who would 
      frequent their pharmacy and moral and ethical concerns as barriers to dispensing 
      naloxone. CONCLUSION: Additional educational programs should be delivered to Ohio 
      pharmacists to inform them of the state law and policies. Continuing education 
      programs that review substance abuse and attempt to reduce social stigma may 
      assist with increasing naloxone distribution to those in need, especially, if 
      directed toward younger pharmacists in Ohio.

TI  - Hiring, training, and supporting Peer Research Associates: Operationalizing 
      community-based research principles within epidemiological studies by, with, and 
      for women living with HIV.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s12954-019-0309-3 [doi]
LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: A community-based research (CBR) approach is critical to redressing 
      the exclusion of women-particularly, traditionally marginalized women including 
      those who use substances-from HIV research participation and benefit. However, 
      few studies have articulated their process of involving and engaging peers, 
      particularly within large-scale cohort studies of women living with HIV where 
      gender, cultural and linguistic diversity, HIV stigma, substance use experience, 
      and power inequities must be navigated. METHODS: Through our work on the Canadian 
      HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS), Canada's 
      largest community-collaborative longitudinal cohort of women living with HIV (n = 
      1422), we developed a comprehensive, regionally tailored approach for hiring, 
      training, and supporting women living with HIV as Peer Research Associates 
      (PRAs). To reflect the diversity of women with HIV in Canada, we initially hired 
      37 PRAs from British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, prioritizing women 
      historically under-represented in research, including women who use or have used 
      illicit drugs, and women living with HIV of other social identities including 
      Indigenous, racialized, LGBTQ2S, and sex work communities, noting important 
      points of intersection between these groups. RESULTS: Building on PRAs' lived 
      experience, research capacity was supported through a comprehensive, multi-phase, 
      and evidence-based experiential training curriculum, with mentorship and support 
      opportunities provided at various stages of the study. Challenges included the 
      following: being responsive to PRAs' diversity; ensuring PRAs' health, 
      well-being, safety, and confidentiality; supporting PRAs to navigate shifting 
      roles in their community; and ensuring sufficient time and resources for the 
      translation of materials between English and French. Opportunities included the 
      following: mutual capacity building of PRAs and researchers; community-informed 
      approaches to study the processes and challenges; enhanced recruitment of 
      harder-to-reach populations; and stronger community partnerships facilitating 
      advocacy and action on findings. CONCLUSIONS: Community-collaborative studies are 
      key to increasing the relevance and impact potential of research. For women 
      living with HIV to participate in and benefit from HIV research, studies must 
      foster inclusive, flexible, safe, and reciprocal approaches to PRA engagement, 
      employment, and training tailored to regional contexts and women's lives. 
      Recommendations for best practice are offered.

      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose is a significant public health issue among people who 
      use pharmaceutical opioids and/or heroin. One response to reducing overdose 
      deaths is to expand public access to naloxone. The Australian Therapeutic Goods 
      Administration down-scheduled naloxone from prescription only (S4) to pharmacist 
      only over-the-counter (OTC, schedule 3) in February 2016. There is little 
      research examining pharmacists' perspectives or experiences of this change. 
      METHODS: Thirty-seven semi-structured interviews with Australian community 
      pharmacists were conducted in 2016-2017 to investigate pharmacists' attitudes to 
      and experiences of OTC naloxone. Transcripts were thematically analysed, guided 
      by a broad interest in facilitators and barriers to OTC supply. RESULTS: Around 
      half of the pharmacists were aware of the down-scheduling and only two had 
      provided OTC naloxone. Core barriers to pharmacist provision of OTC naloxone 
      included limited understanding of opioid overdose, confusion about the role and 
      responsibilities of pharmacists in providing OTC naloxone, concerns about 
      business, stigma related to people who inject drugs (PWID) and system-level 
      challenges. CONCLUSION: Pharmacy provision of OTC naloxone offers an important 
      opportunity to reduce overdose mortality. Our study suggests this opportunity is 
      yet to be realised and highlights several individual- and structural-level 
      impediments hindering the expansion of public access to naloxone via community 
      pharmacies. There is a need to develop strategies to improve pharmacists' 
      knowledge of OTC naloxone and opioid overdose as well as to address other 
      logistical and cultural barriers that limit naloxone provision in pharmacy 
      settings. These need to be addressed at the individual level (training) as well 
      as the system level (information, regulation and supply).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article are to present findings from recent 
      qualitative research with patients in a combined perinatal substance use 
      treatment program in Central Appalachia, and to describe and analyze 
      participants' ambivalence about medication-assisted treatment for opioid use 
      disorder (OUD), in the context of widespread societal stigma and judgement. 
      METHODS: We conducted research in a comprehensive outpatient perinatal substance 
      use treatment program housed in a larger obstetric practice serving a large 
      rural, Central Appalachian region. The program serves patients across the 
      spectrum of substance use disorders but specifically offers medication-assisted 
      treatment to perinatal patients with OUD. We purposively and opportunistically 
      sampled patients receiving prescriptions for buprenorphine or 
      buprenorphine-naloxone dual product, along with prenatal care and other services. 
      Through participant-observation and semi-structured interviews, we gathered 
      qualitative data from 27 participants, in a total of 31 interviews. We analyzed 
      transcripts of interviews and fieldnotes using modified Grounded Theory. RESULTS: 
      Participants in a combined perinatal substance use treatment program value 
      supportive, non-judgmental care but report ambivalence about medication, within 
      structural and institutional contexts of criminalized, stigmatized substance use 
      and close scrutiny of their pregnancies. Women are keenly aware of the social and 
      public consequences for themselves and their parenting, if they begin or continue 
      medication treatment for OUD. CONCLUSIONS: Substance use treatment providers 
      should consider the social consequences of medication treatment, as well as the 
      clinical benefits, when presenting treatment options and recommendations to 
      patients. Patient-centered care must include an understanding of larger social 
      and structural contexts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatalities from opioid overdose quadrupled during the last 15 years 
      as illicit opioid use increased. This study assesses how stigma and drug use 
      settings are associated with non-fatal overdose to identify targets for overdose 
      risk reduction interventions and inform overdose education and naloxone 
      distribution programs. METHODS: We surveyed 444 people who used drugs in 
      Baltimore, Maryland, USA, from 2009 to 2013 as part of a randomized clinical 
      trial of a harm reduction intervention. Participants reported demographic 
      characteristics, drug use, overdose history, use of a local syringe services 
      program, involvement in the local drug economy, and whether they experienced 
      discrimination from others (i.e., enacted stigma) or stigmatized themselves 
      (i.e., internalized stigma) related to their drug use. We used multinomial 
      logistic regression models to identify correlates of experiencing a non-fatal 
      overdose within the past year or >1 year ago relative to participants who never 
      experienced an overdose. RESULTS: Stigma was positively associated with 
      experiencing a non-fatal overdose in the past year (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 
      1.7, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.1-2.7) and >1 year ago (aOR [95% CI]: 1.5 
      [1.1-2.0]) after adjustment for demographic and substance use characteristics. 
      The association of stigma with overdose was stronger for enacted versus 
      internalized stigma. The number of public settings (shooting gallery, crack 
      house, abandoned building, public bathroom, outside) where participants used 
      drugs was also positively associated with experiencing an overdose. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Stigma related to drug use and using drugs in more settings may increase overdose 
      risk. The effectiveness of overdose prevention and naloxone training may be 
      improved by reducing discrimination against people who use drugs in community and 
      medical settings and diversifying the settings in which overdose prevention 
      trainings are delivered. These efforts may be enhanced by use of peer outreach 
      approaches in which people who use drugs diffuse prevention messages through 
      their social networks and within settings of drug consumption outside the medical 
      setting.

TI  - Beliefs Associated with Pharmacy-Based Naloxone: a Qualitative Study of 
      Pharmacy-Based Naloxone Purchasers and People at Risk for Opioid Overdose.
PG  - 367-378
LID - 10.1007/s11524-019-00349-1 [doi]
AB  - Drug overdose is the leading cause of unintentional death in the USA and the 
      majority of deaths involve an opioid. Pharmacies are playing an increasingly 
      important role in getting naloxone-the antidote to an opioid overdose-into the 
      community. The aim of the current study was to understand, from the perspective 
      of those who had obtained naloxone at the pharmacy, whose drug using status and 
      pain patient status was not known until the interviews were conducted, as well as 
      those who had not obtained naloxone at the pharmacy but were at risk for 
      overdose, factors that impact the likelihood of obtaining pharmacy-based naloxone 
      (PBN). Fifty-two participants from two New England states were interviewed 
      between August 2016 and April 2017. We used a phenomenological approach to 
      investigate participants' beliefs about pharmacy-based naloxone. The social 
      contextual model was chosen to structure the collection and analysis of the 
      qualitative data as it takes into account individual, interpersonal, 
      organizational (pharmacy), community, and societal influences on a specific 
      health behavior. Of the 52 people interviewed, 24 participants had obtained 
      naloxone from the pharmacy in the past year, of which 4% (n = 1) self-disclosed 
      during the interview current illicit drug use and 29% (n = 7) mentioned using 
      prescribed opioid pain medication. Of the 28 people who had not obtained naloxone 
      from the pharmacy, 46% (n = 13) had obtained an over the counter syringe from a 
      pharmacy in the past month and had used an opioid in the past month, and 54% 
      (n = 15) had used a prescribed opioid pain medication in the past month but did 
      not report a syringe purchase. Several main themes emerged from the interview 
      data. Individual-level themes were as follows: helplessness and fear, naloxone as 
      empowerment to help, and past experiences at the pharmacy. Interpersonal-level 
      themes were as follows: concern for family and friends, and sources of harm 
      reduction information. Themes associated with pharmacy-level influence were as 
      follows: perceived stigma from pharmacists, confusion at the pharmacy counter, 
      and receptivity to pharmacists' offer of naloxone; community-level themes were as 
      follows: community caretaking and need for education and training. Finally, 
      themes at the societal-level of influence were as follows: generational crisis, 
      and frustration at lack of response to opioid crisis. Overall our findings reveal 
      factors at multiple levels which may play a role in likelihood of obtaining 
      naloxone at the pharmacy. These factors can be used to inform interventions 
      seeking to increase provision of pharmacy-based naloxone.

TI  - Understanding the public health consequences of suspending a rural syringe 
      services program: a qualitative study of the experiences of people who inject 
      drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Syringe services programs (SSPs) are evidence-based interventions 
      that are associated with decreases in prevalence and incidence rates of HIV and 
      viral hepatitis among people who inject drugs (PWID). SSPs are also effective 
      conduits to deliver overdose prevention resources among PWID. In December 2015, 
      the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department (KCHD) in West Virginia implemented a 
      SSP; however, the program was indefinitely suspended in early 2018 following 
      policy changes that would have forced the program to operate in ways that 
      conflicted with established best practices. The purpose of this research is to 
      explore the public health implications of the suspension of the KCHD SSP among 
      rural PWID. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 PWID (59.3% 
      male, 88.9% White) to explore access to sterile injection equipment and overdose 
      prevention resources, high-risk injection practices, and HIV risk perceptions 
      following the KCHD SSP suspension. Participants were recruited from street 
      locations frequented by PWID. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed 
      verbatim. We employed an iterative, modified constant comparison approach to 
      systematically code and synthesize textual interview data. RESULTS: Participants 
      described the KCHD SSP as providing a variety of harm reduction services to PWID 
      and being able to speak honestly with SSP staff about their drug use without fear 
      of stigmatization. The suspension of the KCHD SSP fundamentally changed the 
      public health landscape for PWID, ushering in a new era of increased risks for 
      acquiring bloodborne infections and overdose. PWID described more frequently 
      injecting with used syringes and engaging in a range of high-risk injection 
      practices after the SSP was suspended. PWID also discussed having decreased 
      access to naloxone and being less likely to get routinely tested for HIV 
      following the KCHD SSP suspension. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates that 
      the suspension of a SSP in rural West Virginia increased risks for HIV/HCV 
      acquisition and overdose among PWID. The suspension of the SSP led to 
      community-wide decreases in access to sterile injection equipment and naloxone 
      among PWID. The suspension of the KCHD SSP should be viewed as a call to action 
      for sustaining evidence-based interventions in the face of sociopolitical forces 
      that attempt to subvert public health.

AB  - Post-release opioid-related overdose mortality is the leading cause of death 
      among people released from jails or prisons (PRJP). Informed by the proximate 
      determinants framework, this paper presents the Post-Release Opioid-Related 
      Overdose Risk Model. It explores the underlying, intermediate, proximate and 
      biological determinants which contribute to risk of post-release opioid-related 
      overdose mortality. PRJP share the underlying exposure of incarceration and the 
      increased prevalence of several moderators (chronic pain, HIV infection, trauma, 
      race, and suicidality) of the risk of opioid-related overdose. Intermediate 
      determinants following release from the criminal justice system include 
      disruption of social networks, interruptions in medical care, poverty, and stigma 
      which exacerbate underlying, and highly prevalent, substance use and mental 
      health disorders. Subsequent proximate determinants include interruptions in 
      substance use treatment, including access to medications for opioid use disorder, 
      polypharmacy, polydrug use, insufficient naloxone access, and a return to 
      solitary opioid use. This leads to the final biological determinant of reduced 
      respiratory tolerance and finally opioid-related overdose mortality. Mitigating 
      the risk of opioid-related overdose mortality among PRJP will require improved 
      coordination across criminal justice, health, and community organizations to 
      reduce barriers to social services, ensure access to health insurance, and reduce 
      interruptions in care continuity and reduce stigma. Healthcare services and harm 
      reduction strategies, such as safe injection sites, should be tailored to the 
      needs of PRJP. Expanding access to opioid agonist therapy and naloxone around the 
      post-release period could reduce overdose deaths. Programs are also needed to 
      divert individuals with substance use disorder away from the criminal justice 
      system and into treatment and social services, preventing incarceration exposure.

AB  - The United States opioid epidemic is a nationwide public health crisis. Initially 
      driven by increased consumption and availability of pharmaceutical opioids, an 
      increasing number of opioid overdoses are now related to heroin and illicitly 
      manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Addressing this epidemic requires 
      addressing the stigma associated with opioid use disorders and its treatment, 
      improving access to efficacious treatment options, specifically methadone and 
      buprenorphine, and reducing opioid overdose fatalities with distribution of the 
      opioid antagonist and overdose reversal agent naloxone.

TI  - Managing Opioid Use in Orthopaedic Patients Through Harm Reduction Strategies.
PG  - 129-135
LID - 10.1097/NOR.0000000000000524 [doi]
AB  - Opioids are commonly prescribed in orthopaedics for acute or chronic pain for a 
      variety of conditions, including injury, trauma, degenerative processes, and 
      postsurgical. Patients who are taking opioids because of a substance use disorder 
      (SUD) are also seen in orthopaedics. Patients who are prescribed opioids are at 
      risk of developing an opioid use disorder (OUD). Ten percent of Americans will 
      develop an SUD, which is considered a chronic medical condition that develops due 
      to an imbalance in brain chemistry. In studies, orthopaedic surgeons have a high 
      rate of prescribing opioids, but this rate is decreasing along with national 
      average due to public and provider awareness of the opioid epidemic and 
      professional recommendations. Despite the evidence of a neurobiological cause for 
      SUDs, stigma toward patients with SUDs and a knowledge deficit are common among 
      healthcare professionals, including orthopaedic nurses. A harm reduction approach 
      when working with orthopaedic patients taking opioids either prescribed or used 
      because of an OUD can be applied to reduce the problematic effects of opioids. 
      Harm reduction strategies are supportive to the patient and include education and 
      prevention, adopting evidence-based treatment and communication strategies, and 
      the use of naloxone to prevent opioid overdose.

TI  - Twenty years of the methadone treatment protocol in Ireland: reflections on the 
      role of general practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid dependence, characterised by socio economic disadvantage and 
      significant morbidity and mortality, remains a major public health problem in 
      Ireland. Through the methadone treatment protocol (MTP), Irish general practice 
      has been a leader in the introduction and expansion of Irish harm reduction 
      services, including opioid substitution treatment (OST), needle and syringe 
      programs (NSP) and naloxone provision. These services have been effective in 
      engaging opiate users in treatment, reducing human deficiency virus (HIV) and 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission and reducing-drug related morbidities. 
      Challenges remain in relation to choice of substitution treatments, timely access 
      to OST services, adequate coverage of NSP, naloxone provision and increasing 
      drug-related deaths. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted and designed to 
      present a broad perspective on the Irish MTP and to describe its history and 
      development in terms of clinical care, stakeholder views and changing trends. 
      RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the analysis; The History of the Methadone 
      Treatment Protocol, Service User and Provider Views and Challenges and 
      Developments. Despite the initial concern about methadone maintenance treatment 
      (MMT) in Ireland, increased participation by Irish GPs in the treatment of opioid 
      dependence is observed over the last two decades. There are now over 10,000 
      people on methadone treatment in Ireland, with 40% treated in general practice. 
      The MTP provides structure, remuneration and guidance to GPs and is underpinned 
      by training, ongoing education and a system of quality assurance provided by the 
      Irish College of General Practice (ICGP). Challenges include the negative views 
      of patients around how methadone services are delivered, the stigma associated 
      with methadone treatment, the lack of choice around substitution medication, 
      waiting lists for treatment in certain areas and rates of fatal overdose. 
      CONCLUSION: Twenty years of the MTP has been the mainstay of harm reduction 
      services in Ireland. It has provided a network of specially trained GPs who 
      provide methadone to over 10,000 patients across Ireland within a structured 
      framework of training, quality assurance and remuneration. With the ongoing 
      commitment of Irish specialists in the field of addiction medicine, further 
      improvements to support and treat patients can be made.

TI  - Perceived Causes of Personal versus Witnessed Overdoses among People who Inject 
      Opioids.
PG  - 1929-1937
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2019.1609988 [doi]
AB  - Background: Studies show that people who inject drugs (PWID) underestimate their 
      overdose risk. We sought to explore this phenomenon by comparing how PWID 
      perceive causes of personal overdoses compared to witnessed overdoses. Methods: 
      We analyzed 40 interviews from participants enrolled in a randomized-controlled 
      behavioral intervention to reduce overdose among at-risk PWID in San Francisco 
      from 2014 to 2016. Subjects were current illicit opioid injectors with opioid use 
      disorder, had received take-home naloxone, and had overdosed within five years. 
      Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using thematic content 
      analysis, three analysts coded the interviews and measured interrater 
      reliability. The analysts developed a codebook of a priori and inductively 
      generated codes, and applied it to all interviews. Coding discrepancies were 
      discussed. Results: We used two theoretical frameworks - actor observer bias 
      (AOB) and intragroup stigma - to analyze participants' descriptions of personal 
      and witnessed overdoses. AOB suggests individuals may assign responsibility of 
      their actions to external factors, while assigning responsibility for others' 
      actions to internal mechanisms. Intragroup stigma describes the process whereby 
      people perpetuate stigma within their own group. Related to these concepts, two 
      principal themes were used to describe personal overdose: (1) drug volatility and 
      (2) ascribing blame to others, and witnessed overdoses: (1) greed and (2) 
      inexperience/foolishness. Conclusion/Importance: The differences in perceived 
      causes of personal versus witnessed overdose align with AOB and intragroup 
      stigma. Understanding how these theories shape overdose experiences may improve 
      behavioral interventions by introducing peer based supports and encouraging PWIDs 
      to employ evidence-based safety precautions when using opioids.

TI  - Incidence of future arrests in adults involved in the criminal justice system 
      with opioid use disorder receiving extended release naltrexone compared to 
      treatment as usual.
PG  - 482-486
LID - S0376-8716(18)30818-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.10.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Criminal justice involved (CJS) populations with opioid use disorder 
      (OUD) have high rates of relapse, future arrests, and death upon release. While 
      medication for OUD (MOUD) reduces opioid relapse, concerns regarding diversion 
      and stigma limit treatment in CJS populations. Extended release naltrexone 
      (XR-NTX), as an opioid antagonist, may be more acceptable to CJS administrators. 
      However, the impact of XR-NTX on criminal recidivism remains unknown. METHODS: 
      Arrest data from a published randomized trial comparing XR-NTX to treatment as 
      usual (TAU) was captured by self-report and official state arrest records. 
      Comparisons of future arrests, time to first arrest and total number of arrests 
      were performed using chi square tests and multivariable generalized regression 
      models. Secondary outcomes explored differences in arrests by type and severity 
      of crime, use of opioid and other drugs, and study phase. RESULTS: Of 308 
      participants randomized, 300 had arrest data. The incidence of arrests did not 
      differ between XR-NTX (47.6%) and TAU (42.5%) participants. (ChiSq p = 0.37). 
      Additionally, there was no significant difference in time to first arrest 
      (adjusted HR 1.35, CI 0.96-1.89) and number of arrests per participant (adjusted 
      IR 1.33, CI 0.78-2.27). Controlling for gender, age, previous criminal activity, 
      and use of non-opioid drugs, logistic regression demonstrated no significant 
      difference in incidence of arrests between groups (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 
      0.85-2.22). CONCLUSIONS: We detected no significant difference in arrests between 
      CJS participants with OUD randomized to XR-NTX or TAU. Despite its efficacy in 
      reducing opioid use, XR-NTX alone may be insufficient to reduce criminal 
      recidivism.

TI  - Assessing pharmacy student experience with, knowledge of and attitudes towards 
      harm reduction: illuminating barriers to pharmacist-led harm reduction.

LID - 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the burden from the opioid epidemic continues to increase in the 
      state of Minnesota and across the nation, the University of Minnesota College of 
      Pharmacy seeks to design an innovative, comprehensive harm reduction curriculum 
      in order to better train student pharmacists to serve the varied needs of the 
      greater community. This study examines incoming individuals' baseline knowledge 
      of and attitudes toward harm reduction in order to better inform curriculum 
      planning and to ultimately produce pharmacists capable of impacting the 
      devastating effects of the opioid crisis. METHODS: Incoming first-year pharmacy 
      students took a survey focused on their knowledge of opioid overdose and the drug 
      naloxone and also provided written reflections on their perceptions of harm 
      reduction. Data was coded using consensual qualitative research (CQR) into 
      appropriate domains. RESULTS: Pharmacy students beginning their professional 
      education revealed a lack of knowledge of proper response to an overdose 
      situation, with 18.56% unfamiliar with the opioid antagonist drug naloxone. Close 
      to 10% (9.58%) of students expressed unwillingness to do anything other than call 
      an ambulance during an overdose event, while 8.98% were either unsure or felt 
      that they would not feel compelled to do something to help. Qualitative coding 
      revealed many barriers to students' becoming capable harm reductionists, 
      including lack of knowledge of substance use, addiction, and harm reduction, in 
      addition to the presence of bias and stigma. CONCLUSION: In order to interrupt 
      the cycle of misinformation and stigma within the larger community and the 
      subgroup of medical providers, gaps in student knowledge must be addressed in 
      meaningful, specific ways over the course of their pharmacy education. Evaluating 
      baseline knowledge and beliefs informs the design of a flexible, action-oriented 
      curriculum to produce well-trained pharmacists ready to engage in finding 
      solutions to the opioid crisis.

AB  - : This commentary puts the recent findings by Carroll et al into historical 
      perspective, noting both the long-held problem of medication diversion when 
      pharmacotherapy access is limited, and the ways in which medication diversion 
      concerns and regulations help create those treatment access barriers. Recent 
      efforts to bridge the treatment gap, including increases in Federal funding 
      through the 21st Century Cures Act and expanding the buprenorphine patient cap 
      and scope of eligible providers under the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act 
      (CARA) will likely help; however, important structural barriers remain. Health 
      insurance barriers, including limited Medicaid coverage, combined with stigma 
      against pharmacotherapy persist, which likely means that people in need of 
      treatment will continue to self-treat their symptoms with diverted medications, 
      such as the buprenorphine/naloxone use noted by Carroll and colleagues.

TI  - Being "hooked up" during a sharp increase in the availability of illicitly 
      manufactured fentanyl: Adaptations of drug using practices among people who use 
      drugs (PWUD) in New York City.

AB  - Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), a category of synthetic opioids 50-100 
      times more potent than morphine, is increasingly being added to heroin and other 
      drugs in the United States (US). Persons who use drugs (PWUD) are frequently 
      unaware of the presence of fentanyl in drugs. Use of heroin and other drugs 
      containing fentanyl has been linked to sharp increases in opioid mortality. In 
      New York City (NYC), opioid-related mortality increased from 8.2 per 100,000 
      residents in 2010 to 19.9 per 100,000 residents in 2016; and, in 2016, fentanyl 
      accounted for 44% of NYC overdose deaths. Little is known about how PWUD are 
      adapting to the increase in fentanyl and overdose mortality. This study explores 
      PWUDs' adaptations to drug using practices due to fentanyl. In-depth qualitative 
      interviews were conducted with 55 PWUD at three NYC syringe services programs 
      (SSP) about perceptions of fentanyl, overdose experiences and adaptations of drug 
      using practices. PWUD utilized test shots, a consistent drug dealer, fentanyl 
      test strips, naloxone, getting high with or near others and reducing drug use to 
      protect from overdose. Consistent application of these methods was often negated 
      by structural level factors such as stigma, poverty and homelessness. To address 
      these, multi-level overdose prevention approaches should be implemented in order 
      to reduce the continuing increase in opioid mortality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary care clinics are opportune settings in which to deliver 
      substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, but little is known about which patients 
      initiate treatment in these settings. METHODS: Using secondary data from a RCT 
      that aimed to integrate SUD treatment into a federally qualified health center 
      (FQHC) using an organizational readiness and collaborative care (CC) 
      intervention, we examined patient-level predictors of initiation of 
      evidence-based practices for opioid and/or alcohol use disorders (OAUDs): a brief 
      behavioral treatment (BT) based on motivational interviewing and cognitive 
      behavioral therapy and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) (extended-release 
      injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for patients with an alcohol use disorder or 
      opioid use disorder and buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) for patients with an 
      opioid use disorder). Using the Andersen model of health care access, we tested 
      bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess associations 
      between patient factors and initiation of BT and MAT. RESULTS: Twenty-three 
      percent of all participants (N = 392) received BT and 13% received MAT. In the 
      multivariate model examining factors associated with initiation of BT, being of 
      "other" or "multiple" races compared with being White (OR = 0.45, CI = 0.22, 
      0.92), being homeless (OR = 0.45, CI = 0.21, 0.97) and having been arrested 
      within 90 days of baseline (OR = 0.21 CI = 0.63, 0.69) were associated with 
      significantly lower odds of initiating BT. Greater self-stigma (OR = 1.60, 
      CI = 1.06, 2.42), receiving MAT (OR = 5.52, CI = 2.34, 12.98), and having 
      received the CC study intervention (OR = 12.95, CI = 5.91, 28.37) were associated 
      with higher odds of initiating BT. In the multivariate model examining patient 
      factors associated with initiating MAT, older age (OR = 1.07, CI = 1.03, 1.11), 
      female gender (OR = 3.05, CI = 1.25, 7.46), having a diagnosis of heroin abuse or 
      dependence (with or without alcohol abuse or dependence compared with have a 
      diagnosis of alcohol dependence only (OR = 3.03, CI = 1.17, 7.86), and having 
      received at least one session of BT (OR = 6.42, CI = 2.59, 15.94), were 
      associated with higher odds of initiating MAT. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who 
      initiate BT for OAUDs in a FQHC are less likely to be homeless and more likely to 
      have greater self-stigma. Those who receive MAT are more likely to be of older 
      age, female, and to have a diagnosis of heroin abuse or dependence, with or 
      without concomitant alcohol abuse or dependence, rather than alcohol abuse or 
      dependence alone. Receiving collaborative care (e.g., a warm handoff, and 
      follow-up by a care coordinator) may be critical to initiating BT. Receiving at 
      least one session of BT is associated with higher odds of receiving MAT, and 
      receiving MAT is associated with higher odds of receiving BT. The Andersen model 
      of health care access provides some insight into who initiates BT and MAT for 
      OAUD treatment in FQHC-based primary care; further research is needed to explore 
      system-level factors that may also influence treatment initiation.

TI  - A qualitative study comparing physician-reported barriers to treating addiction 
      using buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone in U.S. office-based 
      practices.

AB  - AIM: Our aim was to compare physician-reported barriers to sublingual 
      buprenorphine (BUP) and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NLT) prescribing in U.S. 
      office-based practices, and to identify potential policies for minimizing these 
      barriers. Only one previous qualitative study has examined physician-reported 
      barriers to prescribing XR-NLT and no qualitative study has compared 
      physician-reported barriers between the two medications. METHODS: Researchers 
      conducted individual semi-structured and in-depth interviews with 20 licensed 
      physicians in four U.S. states between January 2016 and May 2017. Interview 
      questions included general barriers to addiction treatment in office-based 
      settings, barriers specific to BUP and XR-NLT prescribing, and potential 
      government policies to decrease barriers. Researchers conducted thematic analysis 
      of transcribed interviews. They developed and pilot tested a coding template 
      based on a sample of transcripts, independently coded transcripts in Dedoose 
      software, conducted consensus coding to eliminate coding discrepancies, and then 
      assessed data for themes using research questions as a guide. RESULTS: General 
      barriers to office-based OUD treatment included limited physician education, 
      limited insurance reimbursement, stigma, and perceptions of "difficult" patients. 
      Barriers specific to BUP prescribing included regulatory restrictions, liability 
      fears, and restrictions imposed by the criminal justice system. Barriers specific 
      to XR-NLT prescribing included limited access to medically-supervised opioid 
      detoxification, lack of awareness of the medication, and patient fears or 
      disinterest. Participants without experience prescribing either medication 
      emphasized barriers to treating OUD in general. Participants with experience 
      prescribing BUP and/or XR-NLT described barriers to treating OUD in general as 
      well as barriers specific to each medication. Policy makers should increase 
      access to addiction medicine education, mandate insurance coverage of both 
      medications and inpatient detoxification, prohibit excessive insurance prior 
      authorization requirements, increase insurance reimbursement for behavioral 
      healthcare, and incentivize interdisciplinary collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: While 
      overlap exists, some barriers to BUP prescribing differ from barriers to XR-NLT

AB  - Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for the acquisition of HIV/AIDS and is 
      associated with greater disease burden and mortality among those who become 
      HIV-infected. Of the extant pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorders, 
      naltrexone is recognized as one of the most efficacious, producing robust 
      reductions in alcohol craving and use. Given that treatment with oral naltrexone 
      has been limited by problems with adherence, which are particularly prevalent 
      among individuals with multiple chronic, co-occurring conditions, long-acting 
      formulations may be a promising approach for HIV-infected substance users. 
      However, little is known about the barriers to initiation of extended-release 
      naltrexone (XR-NTX) treatment among alcohol users living with HIV. In this report 
      we present and discuss the content analysis of open-ended survey questions, as 
      well as lessons learned, with regards to barriers to initiation and maintenance 
      of XR-NTX treatment collected as part of an RCT evaluating a cognitive behavioral 
      text messaging intervention for HIV-infected adults with alcohol use disorders. 
      Barriers to initiation and maintenance of XR-NTX pharmacotherapy among HIV+ 
      individuals with alcohol use disorders seem to fall in one of two categories: [1] 
      barriers that are amenable to change, which include distance and transportation 
      issues, fear of injections, and belief that alcohol use does not warrant 
      pharmacotherapy, and [2] barriers that are not amenable to change, such as the 
      potential interaction of XR-NTX with another medication regimen.

TI  - Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction in the United States: Critique 
      and Commentary.
PG  - 334-343
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2017.1342662 [doi]
AB  - In the United States, buprenorphine products (namely buprenorphine/naloxone 
      combination) and methadone are the primary forms of medication-assisted treatment 
      (MAT) that are authorized for addressing opioid addiction. Although treatment 
      ideologies differentiate MAT programs, much of the provision in the US reflects a 
      model of "high threshold, low tolerance." This model is discussed with a focus on 
      structural and programmatic barriers that shape access to and retention in MAT. 
      The critique continues with a discussion of multifaceted stigma that reinforces 
      spoiled identities and diffuses into treatment settings. The social control 
      mechanisms that are imposed in MAT are strikingly similar to those reflected in 
      criminal justice settings, namely probation, parole and community corrections 
      more generally. Parallels are drawn between the "addict" and the "felon" and how 
      they are monitored, tracked, and controlled. These factors have major 
      implications for recovery.

TI  - Fentanyl and the Evolving Opioid Epidemic: What Strategies Should Policy Makers 
      Consider?
PG  - 100-103
LID - 10.1176/appi.ps.201700235 [doi]
AB  - Major policy efforts are being aimed at combating the epidemic of opioid 
      addiction and overdose deaths. In response to the epidemic, the medical community 
      and policy makers have attempted to intervene; to date, these varied approaches 
      have done little to reverse the increase in mortality related to opioid overdose. 
      One factor that has complicated efforts to control overdose deaths has been the 
      emergence of a public health crisis related to illicit fentanyl. The rise in 
      fentanyl-related overdose deaths means that new approaches are needed to combat 
      the opioid epidemic, including adoption of harm reduction strategies. Specific 
      strategies that should be considered as part of efforts to combat the opioid 
      crisis include safe drug consumption sites, anonymous drug-checking services, 
      updated naloxone distribution policies, harm reduction-oriented policing, 
      expansion of evidence-based pharmacological treatments in criminal justice and 
      emergency department settings, and stigma-reduction messaging emphasizing the 
      risks of fentanyl.

PG  - 19-23
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000355 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Among people with opioid use disorder (OUD), stigma is a known 
      barrier to accessing treatment and has negative impacts on physical and mental 
      health. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors associated with 
      self-stigma and perceived stigma severity among people with OUD entering an 
      inpatient detoxification program. METHODS: Between December 2015 and August 2016, 
      consecutive persons seeking inpatient opioid detoxification were asked to 
      complete a survey that included sociodemographic, drug use, treatment variables, 
      an 8-item General Self-Stigma scale, and a 3-item Treatment Stigma scale. 
      Correlates of stigma severity were estimated using ordinary least squares 
      regression. RESULTS: The 407 participants had an average age of 32.4 (±8.79) 
      years, with 72.2% male and 84.5% non-Hispanic White. Two-thirds had ever received 
      medication-assisted treatment for OUD and 323 (79.4%) had ever been admitted to a 
      detoxification program. Adjusted mean General Self-Stigma scores were positively 
      and significantly associated with recent injection drug use (b = 0.262, 
      P = 0.032), and having previously entered detoxification programs (b = 0.330, 
      P = 0.016). Adjusted mean Treatment Stigma scores were positively and 
      significantly associated with years of education (b = 0.142, P = 0.002), having 
      ever been prescribed naltrexone (b = 0.277, P = 0.025) and having previously 
      entered detoxification programs (b = 0.389, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: People with 
      OUD presenting for inpatient detoxification struggle with experiences of self and 
      perceived stigma. Strikingly, people with previous detoxification program 
      admission had higher levels of stigma on both scales. Our findings suggest an 
      opportunity for targeted intervention in this group.

      enforcement officers.
PG  - 516-521
LID - 10.1111/phn.12365 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes the implementation and evaluation of revised 
      opioid overdose prevention and education of naloxone training for law enforcement 
      officers (LEOs) that added: (1) a recovery testimony and (2) the process for 
      deputy-initiated referrals postnaloxone administration. DESIGN AND SAMPLE: 
      Evaluation regarding the naloxone training included a pre- and postopioid 
      overdose knowledge surveys (N = 114) and subsequent 1-year postnaloxone training 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Pre- and posttest scores for all knowledge outcome measures 
      were statistically significant (p < .001) with favorable comments pertaining to 
      the recovery testimony. Out of 31 individuals who received naloxone, 6 
      individuals (19.4%) continue to be in treatment or received some treatment 
      services. The most common symptoms reported were unconsciousness/unresponsiveness 
      (40.5%), abnormal breathing patterns (24.3%), and blue lips (16.2%). The majority 
      of the calls (65.6%) were to a residential area, and the time for naloxone 
      revival ranged <1-10 min (M = 3.48; SD = 2.27). CONCLUSION: As nearly 20% of 
      individuals sought treatment after a LEO-initiated referral, it is recommended 
      that other agencies consider the referral process into the training. Future 
      research will investigate the impact of the recovery testimony in reducing the 
      stigma of addiction.

AB  - : In September 2016, the American Academic of Pediatrics released a policy 
      statement that adolescents with opioid use disorder should be offered 
      pharmacotherapy with buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, or naltrexone. In our 
      clinical practice, however, we have encountered the perception among patients, 
      families, and clinicians alike that medications should be used as a last resort. 
      That we should wait until things get worse is a discarded approach. As addiction 
      specialists, it is imperative that we prevent and identify risky use and use 
      disorders, then intervene early and offer timely, evidence-based treatment. We 
      suggest that adolescents deserve special attention and that specific efforts 
      should be made to reduce the stigma associated with treating adolescents with 
      opioid use disorder with medications to optimize those efforts.

TI  - The Role of Pleasure Neurobiology and Dopamine in Mental Health Disorders.
PG  - 17-21
LID - 10.3928/02793695-20170818-09 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence and research has demonstrated that the pleasure response and 
      associated neurotransmitters and brain circuits play a significant role in 
      substance use disorders (SUDs). It was thought that negative behaviors associated 
      with SUDs resulted from negative choices, but it is now known that chemical 
      changes in the brain drive those behaviors. Several mental health disorders 
      (e.g., eating disorders, non-suicidal self-injury, compulsive sex behaviors, 
      internet gaming, gambling) are also thought to involve those same pleasure 
      responses, neurotransmitters, and brain regions. Studies have shown that the use 
      of naltrexone, a dopamine antagonist, can reduce symptoms of these disorders. It 
      is important for nurses to understand the underlying physiology of mental health 
      disorders that are thought to have an addictive or craving component. This 
      understanding can help reduce stigma. Educating patients about likely 
      neurobiological causes for their disorders can also help reduce guilt and shame. 
      Nurses should educate patients about these disorders and evidence-based 
      treatments, including off-label use of naltrexone. [Journal of Psychosocial 
      Nursing and Mental Health Services, 55(9), 17-21.].

TI  - Harm reduction in the USA: the research perspective and an archive to David 
      Purchase.

AB  - The history of harm reduction in the USA has led to the development of some of 
      the most important methods for treating persons for drug use disorders, such as 
      methadone and buprenorphine for opiate use disorder. However, there has been 
      fierce political resistance to implementation and scale-up of harm reduction in 
      the USA. This resistance is rooted in historical demonization of particular 
      psychoactive drugs that were associated with stigmatized racial/ethnic 
      groups.With the discovery of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, 
      harm reduction became important not only for treating substance use disorders, 
      but for reducing transmission of blood-borne infection. However, within the 
      context of the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s, it was very difficult to 
      implement any programs that appeared to "condone" drug use.It was not until the 
      late 1980s that syringe exchange programs began at the state and local level in 
      the USA. With funding primarily from state and local governments and the support 
      of the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN), there are now 
      approximately 200 programs for syringe exchange in the USA. Research has shown 
      that these programs have been extremely effective in reducing human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among persons who inject drugs (PWID). 
      The programs in the USA also offer many additional services for drug users, 
      including condom distribution, referrals to substance abuse treatment, HIV, 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) counseling and testing, overdose 
      education and naloxone distribution to reverse for overdose.Currently, the USA is 
      experiencing an opioid/heroin epidemic, with significant increases in overdose 
      deaths among drug users. Much of this epidemic is occurring in suburban and rural 
      of the country without harm reduction services. The current challenges for harm 
      reduction and harm reduction research involve expansion of services to suburban 
      and rural areas and implementation science on how to effectively and efficiently 
      address HCV transmission and overdose. Most importantly, continued research 
      efforts are needed to reduce the stigma of psychoactive drug use. While political 
      opposition continues, harm reduction activists and researchers have developed a 
      highly effective partnership based on a common core values.

TI  - A qualitative study of reasons for seeking and ceasing opioid substitution 
      treatment in prisons in New South Wales, Australia.
PG  - 305-310
LID - 10.1111/dar.12442 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Opioid substitution treatment (OST) reduces drug-related 
      harms in custody and after release. However, OST providers in prisons have 
      reported that some patients prefer to cease treatment prior to release, placing 
      them at risk of fatal overdose. We aimed to examine reasons for seeking OST in 
      custody, and intentions regarding continuation or cessation of treatment prior to 
      and following release. DESIGN AND METHODS: This qualitative study employed 
      semi-structured interviews with opioid-dependent people currently incarcerated in 
      New South Wales, Australia. RESULTS: Of 46 participants, 27 were currently in 
      OST. Reported benefits of OST included withdrawal management and avoidance of 
      high-risk injecting. Over a third of participants in OST stated their intention 
      to withdraw from OST prior to release. Reasons included concerns that attending 
      community OST clinics could lead to drug use or offending, family opposition, 
      inconvenience of clinic attendance, stigma and a perception that prison provided 
      an opportunity to withdraw from OST more easily than in the community. Nineteen 
      participants had already ceased OST in custody or had declined it, citing 
      preferences to 'be clean' and the long-term nature of OST. DISCUSSION AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: Balancing the preference of many patients to cease OST prior to 
      release against patient safety post-release is a substantial challenge for opioid 
      treatment providers in correctional settings. These findings indicate the need 
      for research on how best to attract and retain opioid-dependent prisoners in 
      treatment and the need to provide other interventions for prisoners uninterested 
      in post-release OST, such as take-home naloxone. [Larney S, Zador D, Sindicich N,

TI  - Proceedings from Bridging Health Disparities to Address the Opioid Epidemic: A 
      Symposium at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
PG  - 16-18
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: In response to the unprecedented rates of illicit drug use, 
      including opioid addiction and overdose in Rhode Island, local healthcare 
      institutions, led by the Warren Alpert Medical School (AMS) of Brown University, 
      collaborated to present "Bridging Health Disparities to Address the Opioid 
      Epidemic." This symposium sought to educate a wide array of healthcare providers 
      and professionals around opioid use disorder, including the state of the opioid 
      crisis in Rhode Island, national efforts around opioid misuse and how providers 
      can work together to stem the opioid crisis in the state. DESIGN AND METHODS: The 
      symposium included a keynote session which aimed to increase knowledge and 
      decrease stigma. This was followed by two rounds of breakout sessions which 
      focused on various components of opioid disorder treatment. We elicited feedback 
      from participants in order to plan further interventions to educate providers in 
      Rhode Island around the opioid epidemic. Primary Results: Initial feedback was 
      positive. More importantly, this workshop allowed us to identify gaps in 
      knowledge amongst healthcare providers in Rhode Island in order to plan further 
      interventions for healthcare providers, including physicians, around opioid 
      misuse, in Rhode Island. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: This symposium is one of the 
      first steps that a consortium of healthcare institutions, including AMS, will 
      take to address the opioid crisis in Rhode Island. Feedback from the event was 
      elicited to identify gaps in healthcare provider knowledge and will be used to 
      design and implement further interventions. [Full article available at

TI  - Perpetuating stigma or reducing risk? Perspectives from naloxone consumers and 
      pharmacists on pharmacy-based naloxone in 2 states.

LID - S1544-3191(17)30013-4 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about attitudes of pharmacists and consumers to 
      pharmacy naloxone. We examined perceptions and experiences of pharmacy naloxone 
      from people with opioid use disorder, patients taking chronic opioids for pain, 
      caregivers of opioid users, and pharmacists from 2 early pharmacy naloxone 
      adopter states: Massachusetts and Rhode Island. DESIGN: Eight focus groups (4 per 
      state) were held in October to December 2015. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Participants were recruited from pharmacies, health clinics, and community 
      organizations; pharmacists were recruited from professional organizations and 
      pharmacy colleges. OUTCOME MEASURES: Focus groups were led by trained qualitative 
      researchers using a topic guide, and recorded and transcribed for analysis. Five 
      analysts developed and applied a coding scheme to transcripts. Thematic analysis 
      involved synthesis of coded data and connections between key themes, with 
      comparisons across the groups. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants included patients 
      with chronic pain (n = 15), people with opioid use disorders (n = 19), caregivers 
      (n = 16), and pharmacists (n = 11). A majority of pharmacists had dispensed 
      naloxone to patients; a minority of all consumer participants had obtained 
      pharmacy naloxone. Four themes emerged: consumer fear of future consequences if 
      requesting naloxone; pharmacists' concerns about practice logistics related to 
      naloxone; differing perceptions of how opioid safety is addressed in the 
      pharmacy; and solutions to addressing these barriers. Whereas consumer groups 
      differed in awareness of naloxone and availability at pharmacies, all groups 
      expressed support for the pharmacist's role and preferences for a universal offer 
      of naloxone based on clear criteria. CONCLUSION: Pharmacies complement community 
      naloxone provision to patients and caregivers. To overcome stigma of naloxone 
      receipt, increased public awareness of naloxone and pharmacist training about 
      naloxone and addiction are required. Pharmacists should offer naloxone via 
      universal opt-out strategies-where all patients meeting evidence-based criteria 
      are offered naloxone-rather than targeted or opt-in strategies-where only 
      patients perceived as high risk or patients who request it are offered naloxone.

TI  - Should the United States Government Repeal Restrictions on Buprenorphine/Naloxone 
      Treatment?
PG  - 1674-1679
AB  - Attention must be focused on needed changes to the current United States law that 
      restricts physicians who prescribe buprenorphine for the detoxification or 
      treatment of Opioid Use Disorder, to accepting no more than 100 patients. The 
      current system does not provide comprehensive treatment as defined by the 
      American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria. In addition, it suffers 
      from both fragmentation and stigma and will require a significant change to 
      comply with ASAM's call for integrated delivery of comprehensive addiction 
      treatment. This commentary calls for the development and implementation of "best 
      practice," by recommending caution in lifting the 100 patient limit until 
      substantial achievement of this goal occurs. The authors call for an increase to 
      200 in the patient limit to be restricted to those physicians who are Board 
      Certified in Addiction Medicine by the American Board of Addiction Medicine 
      (ABAM) or in Addiction Psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and 
      Neurology (ABPN), or other responsible medical organizations. Any additional 
      restriction lifting should follow a systemic evolution that rewards and documents 
      competency. Such a system would involve the integration of treatment, treatment 
      systems, and recovery with prescription medication. In addition, it should 
      monitor emotional blunting, treatment progress and initiation of genetic 
      addiction risk testing.

      administered naloxone as an overdose prevention strategy.

AB  - AIMS: To identify perceived barriers to the prescription of naloxone to 
      third-party contacts of opiate users. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. 
      SETTING: Two academic hospitals in Baltimore, MD, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty 
      medical providers, including both physicians and medical students. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Qualitative; in-depth interviews and focus groups analyzed using line-by-line, 
      focused, and axial coding based on methods adapted from grounded theory. 
      FINDINGS: Academic physicians and medical students cited three categories of 
      barriers to naloxone prescription related to drug, provider, and patient 
      characteristics. Concerns about naloxone itself included inability to prevent 
      addictive behaviors, duration of action, medical risks, expiration date, and 
      route of administration. Concerns about medical providers included lack of 
      knowledge or experience, medical community common practices and norms, 
      insufficient provision of third-party education, physician and clinic scheduling 
      practices, worry about insulting patients, and fear of being viewed as enabling 
      drug abuse. Concerns about patients included increased risk-taking behaviors, 
      opiate withdrawal symptoms, potential repeat overdose related to 
      withdrawal-discomfort, decreased contact with medical providers, and stigma. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minimizing barriers to naloxone provision may increase acceptability 
      and prescription practice in the medical community. Addressing these barriers 
      from multiple provider perspectives is critical to advance naloxone prescription 
      as a harm reduction strategy, which has the potential to prevent opiate 
      overdoses.

AB  - Unintentional drug overdose is a leading cause of preventable death in the United 
      States. Administration of naloxone hydrochloride ("naloxone") can reverse a 
      potentially fatal opioid overdose and save lives. The school nurse is an 
      essential part of the school team responsible for developing emergency response 
      procedures and should facilitate access to naloxone for the management of 
      opioid-related overdose in the school setting. Delaware has been leading efforts 
      to provide education, increase awareness, and help erase the stigma of substance 
      use disorder through school nurse collaboration with a grassroots organization 
      and state stakeholders. This article discusses the successful implementation of 
      naloxone use in the school setting in Delaware public high schools.

TI  - Assessment of provider attitudes toward #naloxone on Twitter.
PG  - 35-41
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2015.1129390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As opioid overdose rates continue to pose a major public health 
      crisis, the need for naloxone treatment by emergency first responders is 
      critical. Little is known about the views of those who administer naloxone. The 
      current study examines attitudes of health professionals on the social media 
      platform Twitter to better understand their perceptions of opioid users, the role 
      of naloxone, and potential training needs. METHODS: Public comments on Twitter 
      regarding naloxone were collected for a period of 3 consecutive months. The 
      occupations of individuals who posted tweets were identified through Twitter 
      profiles or hashtags. Categories of emergency service first responders and 
      medical personnel were created. Qualitative analysis using a grounded theory 
      approach was used to produce thematic content. The relationships between 
      occupation and each theme were analyzed using Pearson chi-square statistics and 
      post hoc analyses. RESULTS: A total of 368 individuals posted 467 
      naloxone-related tweets. Occupations consisted of professional first responders 
      such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs), firefighters, and paramedics (n = 
      122); law enforcement officers (n = 70); nurses (n = 62); physicians (n = 48); 
      other health professionals including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, 
      counselors, and social workers (n = 31); naloxone-trained individuals (n = 12); 
      and students (n = 23). Primary themes included burnout, education and training, 
      information seeking, news updates, optimism, policy and economics, stigma, and 
      treatment. The highest levels of burnout, fatigue, and stigma regarding naloxone 
      and opioid overdose were among nurses, EMTs, other health care providers, and 
      physicians. In contrast, individuals who self-identified as "naloxone-trained" 
      had the highest optimism and the lowest amount of burnout and stigma. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Provider training and refinement of naloxone administration 
      procedures are needed to improve treatment outcomes and reduce provider stigma. 
      Social networking sites such as Twitter may have potential for offering 
      psychoeducation to health care providers.

TI  - Barriers to implementation of opioid overdose prevention programs in Ohio.
PG  - 42-6
LID - 10.1080/08897077.2015.1132294 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nationally, overdose fatalities have reached epidemic proportions. 
      Ohio has one of the highest overdose death rates in the country, as well as high 
      rates of prescription opioid trafficking. METHODS: A cross-sectional self-report 
      survey of opioid overdose prevention programs (OOPPs) in Ohio was conducted 
      between August and October 2014 to characterize programs and ascertain barriers 
      to successful implementation. A 91% response rate was achieved with 18 programs 
      participating in the study. RESULTS: The first Ohio OOPP opened in August 2012, a 
      second program opened in 2013, and the remaining programs began in 2014. All of 
      the programs distribute nasal naloxone and provide overdose prevention education, 
      and 89% (n = 16) provide overdose kits for free. Six OOPPs are funded by the Ohio 
      Department of Health, 3 programs are funded by a local health foundation, and 
      several other public and private funding sources were reported. The OOPPs have 
      funding to distribute a combined total of 8,670 overdose kits and had distributed 
      1998 kits by October 2014. The OOPPs reported 149 overdose reversals. Fifteen 
      programs (83%) reported implementation barriers that were categorized as stigma-, 
      cost-, staffing-, legal, regulatory, and client-related problems. Legislative 
      changes aimed at removing some of the obstacles to distribution and lay 
      administration of naloxone have recently been enacted in Ohio. CONCLUSIONS: OOPPs 
      have rapidly expanded in Ohio during the past 3 years. Although recent 
      legislative changes have addressed some of the reported implementation barriers, 
      stigma and the cost of naloxone remain significant problems.

TI  - Opioid substitution treatment in New Zealand: a 40 year perspective.
PG  - 57-66
AB  - We provide an overview of the history and philosophy of the treatment for opioid 
      dependence, which has been dominated by methadone substitution treatment for the 
      past 40 years in New Zealand. Although changes in approach have occurred over 
      this time, influenced by various sociopolitical events and changing ideologies, 
      opioid substitution treatment has still "not come of age". It remains undermined 
      by stigma and risk concerns associated with methadone and has struggled to be 
      accessible and attractive to illicit opioid drug users, comprehensive and 
      integrated into mainstream health care. However, the introduction in 2012 of 
      Pharmac-subsidised buprenorphine combined with naloxone (Suboxone) in the context 
      of an emerging trend towards a broader recovery and well-being orientation could 
      signal a new era in treatment. The availability of buprenorphine-naloxone may 
      also facilitate a further shift in treatment from primarily siloed specialist 
      addiction services to integrated primary care services. This shift will help 
      reduce stigma, promote patient self-management and community integration and 
      align opioid substitution treatment with treatment for other chronic health 
      conditions such as diabetes and asthma.

TI  - Pharmacies as providers of expanded health services for people who inject drugs: 
      a review of laws, policies, and barriers in six countries.
PG  - 261
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-14-261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) are underserved by health providers 
      but pharmacies may be their most accessible care settings. METHODS: Studies in 
      the U.S., Russia, Vietnam, China, Canada and Mexico employed a three-level 
      (macro-, meso-, and micro-) model to assess feasibility of expanded pharmacy 
      services for PWID. Studies employed qualitative and quantitative interviews, 
      review of legal and policy documents, and information on the knowledge, 
      attitudes, and practices of key stakeholders. RESULTS: Studies produced a mixed 
      assessment of feasibility. Provision of information and referrals by pharmacies 
      is permissible in all study sites and sale and safe disposal of needles/syringes 
      by pharmacies is legal in almost all sites, although needle/syringe sales face 
      challenges related to attitudes and practices of pharmacists, police, and other 
      actors. Pharmacy provision of HIV testing, hepatitis vaccination, opioid 
      substitution treatment, provision of naloxone for drug overdose, and abscess 
      treatment, face more serious legal and policy barriers. DISCUSSION: Challenges to 
      expanded services for drug users in pharmacies exist at all three levels, 
      especially the macro-level characterized by legal barriers and persistent 
      stigmatization of PWID. Where deficiencies in laws, policies, and community 
      attitudes block implementation, stakeholders should advocate for needed legal and 
      policy changes and work to address community stigma and resistance. Laws and 
      policies are only as good as their implementation, so attention is also needed to 
      meso- and micro- levels. Policies, attitudes, and practices of police departments 
      and pharmacy chains as well as knowledge, attitudes, and practices of individual 
      PWID, individual pharmacies, and police officers should support rather than 
      undermine positive laws and expanded services. Despite the challenges, pharmacies 
      remain potentially important venues for delivering health services to PWID.

TI  - Utilizing buprenorphine-naloxone to treat illicit and prescription-opioid 
      dependence.
PG  - 587-98
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S39692 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review current evidence on buprenorphine-naloxone (bup/nx) for the 
      treatment of opioid-use disorders, with a focus on strategies for clinical 
      management and office-based patient care. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Medline and the 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Consensus reports, 
      guidelines published, and other authoritative sources were also included in this 
      review. Apart from expert guidelines, data included in this review constitute 
      level 1 evidence. FINDINGS: Bup/nx is a partial μ-opioid agonist combined with 
      the opioid antagonist naloxone in a 4:1 ratio. It has a lower abuse potential, 
      carries less stigma, and allows for more flexibility than methadone. Bup/nx is 
      indicated for both inpatient and ambulatory medically assisted withdrawal (acute 
      detoxification) and long-term substitution treatment (maintenance) of patients 
      who have a mild-to-moderate physical dependence. A stepwise long-term 
      substitution treatment with regular monitoring and follow-up assessment is 
      usually preferred, as it has better outcomes in reducing illicit opioid use, 
      minimizing concomitant risks such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C 
      transmission, retaining patients in treatment and improving global functioning. 
      CONCLUSION: Bup/nx is safe and effective for opioid detoxification and 
      substitution treatment. Its unique pharmaceutical properties make it particularly 
      suitable for office-based maintenance treatment of opioid-use disorder.

      dependence: selecting the appropriate drug for treatment.
PG  - 557-68
LID - 10.1111/j.1521-0391.2010.00086.x [doi]
AB  - Maintenance therapy with methadone or buprenorphine-based regimens reduces opioid 
      dependence and associated harms. The perception that methadone is more effective 
      than buprenorphine for maintenance treatment has been based on low buprenorphine 
      doses and excessively slow induction regimens used in early buprenorphine trials. 
      Subsequent studies show that the efficacy of buprenorphine sublingual tablet 
      (Subutex®) or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet (Suboxone®) is equivalent 
      to that of methadone when sufficient buprenorphine doses, rapid induction, and 
      flexible dosing are used. Although methadone remains an essential maintenance 
      therapy option, buprenorphine-based regimens increase access to care and provide 
      safer, more appropriate treatment than methadone for some patients.

TI  - Effect of Crocus sativus L. (saffron) stigma and its constituents, crocin and 
      safranal, on morphine withdrawal syndrome in mice.
PG  - 726-30
LID - 10.1002/ptr.3011 [doi]
AB  - Crocus sativus L. has been shown to interact with the opioid system. Thus, the 
      effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stigma and its constituents were 
      evaluated on morphine-withdrawal syndrome in mice. Dependence was induced using 
      subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine for 3 days. On day 4, morphine was 
      injected 0.5 h prior the interaperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the extracts, 
      crocin, safranal, clonidine (0.3 mg/kg) or normal saline. Naloxone was injected 
      (5 mg/kg i.p.) 2 h after the final dose of morphine and the number of episodes of 
      jumping during 30 mm was considered as the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome. 
      Clonidine, the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of saffron reduced the jumping 
      activity. Safranal was injected (s.c.) 30 mm prior and 1 and 2 h after the 
      injection of morphine. It potentiated some signs of withdrawal syndrome. The 
      aqueous extract decreased the movement in all of the doses (80, 160, 320 mg/kg) 
      and the ethanolic extract decreased it in the dose of 800 mg/kg in open field 
      test. But crocin and the dose of 400 mg/kg ethanolic extract showed no effect on 
      activity in this test. It is concluded that the extracts and crocin may have 
      interaction with the opioid system to reduce withdrawal syndrome.
